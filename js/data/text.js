let adlibtext = `I would like to begin by talking about messengers. Messengers always exist in a triangular situation–the one who sends the message, the message-bearer, whether human or inorganic, and the one who receives the message. Picture, therefore, a triangle, but not a complete triangle:something more like an upside-down V. The writer and the reader are at the two lateral corners, but there’s no line joining them. Between them–whether above or below–isa third point, which is the written word, or the text, or the book, or the poem, or the letter, or whatever you would like to call it. This third point is the only point of contact between the other two. As I used to say to my writing students in the distant days when I had some,“Respect the page. It’s all you’ve got.”The writer communicates with the page. The reader also communicates with the page. The writer and the reader communicate only through the page. This is one of the syllogisms of writing as such. Pay no attention to the facsimiles of the writer that appear on talk shows, in newspaper interviews, and the like–they ought not to have anything to do with what goes on between you, the, and the page you are reading, where an invisible hand has previously left some marks for you to decipher,much as one of John Le Carré’s dead spies has left a water-logged shoe with a small packet in it for George Smiley. I know this is a far-fetched image, but it is also curious lyapt, since the reader is–among other things–a sort of spy. A spy, a trespasser, someone in the habit of reading other people’s letters and diaries. As Northrop Frye hasimplied, the reader does not hear, he overhears.8So far I’ve spoken primarily about writers. Now it’s the turn of readers, more or less. The questions I would like to pose are,first: for whom does the writer write? And,secondly: what is the book’s function–or duty, if you like–in its position between writer and reader? What ought it to be doing, in the opinion of its writer? And finally, a third question arising from the other two: whereis the writer when the reader is reading?If you really are in the habit of reading other people’s letters and diaries, you’ll know the answer to that one straightaway: when you are reading, the writer is not inthe same room. If he were, either you’d be talking together,or he’d catch you in the act.For whom does the writer write? The question poses itself most simply in the case of the diary-writer or journal-keeper. Only very occasionally is the answer specifically no one, but this is a misdirection, because we couldn’t hear it unless a writer had put it in a book and published it for us to read. I do not read today what I wrote yesterday; nor shall I read this tomorrow. I write simply so my hand can move, mythoughts move of their own accord. I write to kill a sleepless hour.A likely story, and it is a likely story – we, the readers,believe it easily enough. But the truth–the real truth,the truth behind the illusion–is that the writing is not by Doctor Glas, and it’s not addressed to no one. It’s by Hjalmar S ̈oderberg, and it’s addressed to us.The fictional writer who writes to no one is rare. More usually, even fictional writers writing fictional journals wish to suppose a reader. Here is a passage from George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, a book I read as a young person, shortly after it first came out in 1949. As we know,Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place in a grimy totalitarian future ruled by Big Brother. The hero, Winston Smith, hasseen in a junk-store window a forbidden object:“a thick,quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover”and“smooth creamy paper.”He has been seized by the desire to possess this book, despite the dangers that owning it would entail. Who among writers has not been overcome by a similar desire? And who has not been aware, too, of the dangers–specifically, the dangers of self-revelation? Because if you get hold of a blank book,especially one with creamy pages, you will be driven to write in it. 




A chair, a table, a lamp. Above, on the white ceiling, a relief ornament in the shape of a wreath, and in the centre of it a blank space, plastered over, like the place in a face where the eye has been taken out. There must have been a chandelier, once. They’ve removed anything you could tie a rope to.
A window, two white curtains. Under the window, a window seat with a little cushion. When the window is partly open – it only opens partly – the air can come in and make the curtains move. I can sit in the chair, or on the window seat, hands folded, and watch this. Sunlight comes in through the window too, and falls on the floor, which is made of wood, in narrow strips, highly polished. I can smell the polish. There’s a rug on the floor, oval, of braided rags. This is the kind of touch they like: folk art, archaic, made by women, in their spare time, from things that have no further use. A return to traditional values. Waste not want not. I am not being wasted. Why do I want?
On the wall above the chair, a picture, framed but with no glass: a print of flowers, blue irises, water-colour. Flowers are still allowed. Does each of us have the same print, the same chair, the same white curtains, I wonder? Government issue?
Think of it as being in the army, said Aunt Lydia.
A bed. Single, mattress medium-hard, covered with a flocked white spread. Nothing takes place in the bed but sleep; or no sleep. I try not to think too much. Like other things now, thought must be rationed. There’s a lot that doesn’t bear thinking about. Thinking can hurt your chances, and I intend to last. I know why there is no glass, in front of the watercolour picture of blue irises, and why the window only opens partly and why the glass in it is shatterproof. It isn’t running away they’re afraid of. We wouldn’t get far. It’s those other escapes, the ones you can open in yourself, given a cutting edge.
So. Apart from these details, this could be a college guest room, for the less distinguished visitors; or a room in a rooming house, of former times, for ladies in reduced circumstances. That is what we are now. The circumstances have been reduced; for those of us who still have circumstances.
But a chair, sunlight, flowers: these are not to be dismissed. I am alive, I live, I breathe, I put my hand out, unfolded, into the sunlight. Where I am is not a prison but a privilege, as Aunt Lydia said, who was in love with either/or.
The bell that measures time is ringing. Time here is measured by bells, as once in nunneries. As in a nunnery too, there are few mirrors.
I get up out of the chair, advance my feet into the sunlight, in their red shoes, flat-heeled to save the spine and not for dancing. The red gloves are lying on the bed. I pick them up, pull them onto my hands, finger by finger. Everything except the wings around my face is red: the colour of blood, which defines us. The skirt is ankle-length, full, gathered to a flat yoke that extends over the breasts, the sleeves are full. The white wings too are prescribed issue; they are to keep us from seeing, but also from being seen. I never looked good in red, it’s not my colour. I pick up the shopping basket, put it over my arm.
The door of the room – not my room, I refuse to say my – is not locked. In fact it doesn’t shut properly. I go out into the polished hallway, which has a runner down the centre, dusty pink. Like a path through the forest, like a carpet for royalty, it shows me the way.
The carpet bends and goes down the front staircase and I go with it, one hand on the banister, once a tree, turned in another century, rubbed to a warm gloss. Late Victorian, the house is, a family house, built for a large rich family. There’s a grandfather clock in the hallway, which doles out time, and then the door to the motherly front sitting room, with its fleshtones and hints. A sitting room in which I never sit, but stand or kneel only. At the end of the hallway, above the front door, is a fanlight of coloured glass: flowers, red and blue.
There remains a mirror, on the hall wall. If I turn my head so that the white wings framing my face direct my vision towards it, I can see it as I go down the stairs, round, convex, a pier-glass, like the eye of a fish, and myself in it like a distorted shadow, a parody of something, some fairytale figure in a red cloak, descending towards a moment of carelessness that is the same as danger. A Sister, dipped in blood.
At the bottom of the stairs there’s a hat-and-umbrella stand, the bentwood kind, long rounded rungs of wood curving gently up into hooks shaped like the opening fronds of a fern. There are several umbrellas in it: black, for the Commander, blue, for the Commander’s Wife, and the one assigned to me, which is red. I leave the red umbrella where it is, because I know from the window that the day is sunny. I wonder whether or not the Commander’s Wife is in the sitting room. She doesn’t always sit. Sometimes I can hear her pacing back and forth, a heavy step and then a light one, and the soft tap of her cane on the dusty-rose carpet.
I walk along the hallway, past the sitting-room door and the door that leads into the dining room, and open the door at the end of the hall and go through into the kitchen. Here the smell is no longer of furniture polish. Rita is in here, standing at the kitchen table, which has a top of chipped white enamel. She’s in her usual Martha’s dress, which is dull green, like a surgeon’s gown of the time before. The dress is much like mine in shape, long and concealing, but with a bib apron over it and without the white wings and the veil. She puts the veil on to go outside, but nobody much cares who sees the face of a Martha. Her sleeves are rolled to the elbow, showing her brown arms. She’s making bread, throwing the loaves for the final brief kneading and then the shaping.
Rita sees me and nods, whether in greeting or in simple acknowledgement of my presence it’s hard to say, and wipes her floury hands on her apron and rummages in the kitchen drawer for the token book. Frowning, she tears out three tokens and hands them to me. Her face might be kindly if she would smile. But the frown isn’t personal: it’s the red dress she disapproves of, and what it stands for. She thinks I may be catching, like a disease or any form of bad luck.
Sometimes I listen outside closed doors, a thing I never would have done in the time before. I don’t listen long, because I don’t want to be caught doing it. Once, though, I heard Rita say to Cora that she wouldn’t debase herself like that.
Nobody asking you, Cora said. Anyways, what could you do, supposing?
Go to the Colonies, Rita said. They have the choice.
With the Unwomen, and starve to death and Lord knows what all? said Cora. Catch you.
They were shelling peas; even through the almost-closed door I could hear the light clink of the hard peas falling into the metal bowl. I heard Rita, a grunt or a sigh, of protest or agreement.
Anyways, they’re doing it for us all, said Cora, or so they say. If I hadn’t of got my tubes tied, it could of been me, say I was ten years younger. It’s not that bad. It’s not what you’d call hard work.
Better her than me, Rita said, and I opened the door. Their faces were the way women’s faces are when they’ve been talking about you behind your back and they think you’ve heard: embarrassed, but also a little defiant, as if it were their right. That day, Cora was more pleasant to me than usual, Rita more surly.
Today, despite Rita’s closed face and pressed lips, I would like to stay here, in the kitchen. Cora might come in, from somewhere else in the house, carrying her bottle of lemon oil and her duster, and Rita would make coffee – in the houses of the Commanders there is still real coffee – and we would sit at Rita’s kitchen table, which is not Rita’s any more than my table is mine, and we would talk, about aches and pains, illnesses, our feet, our backs, all the different kinds of mischief that our bodies, like unruly children, can get up to. We would nod our heads as punctuation to each other’s voices, signalling that yes, we know all about it. We would exchange remedies and try to outdo each other in the recital of our physical miseries; gently we would complain, our voices soft and minor-key and mournful as pigeons in the eaves troughs. I know what you mean, we’d say. Or, a quaint expression you sometimes hear, still, from older people: I hear where you’re coming from, as if the voice itself were a traveller, arriving from a distant place. Which it would be, which it is.
How I used to despise such talk. Now I long for it. At least it was talk. An exchange, of sorts.
Or we would gossip. The Marthas know things, they talk among themselves, passing the unofficial news from house to house. Like me, they listen at doors, no doubt, and see things even with their eyes averted. I’ve heard them at it sometimes, caught whiffs of their private conversations. Stillborn, it was. Or, Stabbed her with a knitting needle, right in the belly. Jealousy, it must have been, eating her up. Or, tantalizingly, It was toilet cleaner she used. Worked like a charm, though you’d think he’d of tasted it. Must’ve been that drunk; but they found her out all right.
Or I would help Rita to make the bread, sinking my hands into that soft resistant warmth which is so much like flesh. I hunger to touch something, other than cloth or wood. I hunger to commit the act of touch.
But even if I were to ask, even if I were to violate decorum to that extent, Rita would not allow it. She would be too afraid. The Marthas are not supposed to fraternize with us.
Fraternize means to behave like a brother. Luke told me that. He said there was no corresponding word that meant to behave like a sister. Sororize, it would have to be, he said. From the Latin. He liked knowing about such details. The derivations of words, curious usages. I used to tease him about being pedantic.
I take the tokens from Rita’s outstretched hand. They have pictures on them, of the things they can be exchanged for: twelve eggs, a piece of cheese, a brown thing that’s supposed to be a steak. I place them in the zippered pocket in my sleeve, where I keep my pass.
‘Tell them fresh, for the eggs,’ she says. ‘Not like last time. And a chicken, tell them, not a hen. Tell them who it’s for and then they won’t mess around.’
‘All right,’ I say. I don’t smile. Why tempt her to friendship?


The Master of Iria of Westpool, Birch, didn't own the old house, but he did own the central and richest lands of the old domain. His father, more interested in vines and orchards than in quarrels with his relatives, had left Birch a thriving property. Birch hired men to manage the farms and wineries and cooperate and cartage and all, while he enjoyed his wealth. He married the timid daughter of the younger brother of the Lord of Wayfirth, and took infinite pleasure in thinking that his daughters were of noble blood.
The fashion of the time among the nobility was to have a wizard in their service, a genuine wizard with a staff and a grey cloak, trained on the Isle of the Wise; and so the Master of Iria of Westpool got himself a wizard from Roke. He was surprised how easy it was to get one, if you paid the price.
The young man, called Ivory, did not actually have his staff and cloak yet; he explained that he was to be made wizard when he went back to Roke. The Masters had sent him out into the world to gain experience, for all the classes in the school cannot give a man the experience he needs to be a wizard. Birch looked a little dubious at this, and Ivory reassured him that his training on Roke had equipped him with every kind of magic that could be needed in Iria of Westpool on Way. To prove it, he made it seem that a herd of deer ran through the dining hall, followed by a flight of swans, who marvellously soared through the south wall and out through the north wall; and lastly a fountain in a silver basin sprang up in the center of the table, and when the Master and his family cautiously imitated their wizard and filled their cups from it and tasted it, it was a sweet golden wine. "Wine of the Andrades," said the young man with a modest, complacent smile. By then the wife and daughters were entirely won over. And Birch thought the young man was worth his fee, although his own silent preference was for the dry red Fanian of his own vineyards, which got you drunk if you drank enough, while this yellow stuff was just honeywater.
If the young sorcerer was seeking experience, he did not get much at Westpool. Whenever Birch had guests from Kembermouth or from neighboring domains, the herd of deer, the swans, and the fountain of golden wine made their appearance. He also worked up some very pretty fireworks for warm spring evenings. But if the managers of the orchards and vineyards came to the Master to ask if his wizard might put a spell of increase on the pears this year or maybe charm the black rot off the Fanian vines on the south hill, Birch said, "A wizard of Roke doesn't lower himself to such stuff. Go tell the village sorcerer to earn his keep!" And when the youngest daughter came down with a wasting cough, Birch's wife dared not trouble the wise young man about it, but sent humbly to Rose of Old Iria, asking her to come in by the back door and maybe make a poultice or sing a chant to bring the girl back to health.
Ivory never noticed that the girl was ailing, nor the pear trees, nor the vines. He kept himself to himself, as a man of craft and learning should. He spent his days riding about the countryside on the pretty black mare that his employer had given him for his use when he made it clear that he had not come from Roke to trudge about on foot in the mud and dust of country byways.
On his rides he sometimes passed an old house on a hill among great oaks. Once he turned off the village lane up the hill, but a pack of scrawny, evil-mouthed dogs came pelting and bellowing down at him. The mare was afraid of dogs and liable to buck and bolt, so after that he kept his distance. But he had an eye for beauty, and he liked to look and the old house dreaming away in the dappled light of the early summer afternoons.
He asked Birch about the place. "That's Iria," Birch said -- "Old Iria, I mean to say. I own that house by rights. But after a century of feuds and fights over it, my granddad let the place go to settle the quarrel. Though the Master there would still be quarreling with me if he didn't keep too drunk to talk. Haven't seen the old man for years. He had a daughter, I think."
"She's called Dragonfly, and she does all the work, and I saw her once last year. She's tall, and as beautiful as a flowering tree," said the youngest daughter, Rose, who was busy crowding a lifetime of keen observation into the fourteen years that were all she was going to have for it. She broke off, coughing. Her mother shot an anguished, yearning glance at the wizard. Surely he would hear that cough, this time? He smiled at young Rose, and the mother's heart lifted. Surely he wouldn't smile so if Rose's cough was anything serious?
"Nothing to do with us, that lot at the old place," Birch said, displeased. The tactful Ivory asked no more. But he wanted to see the girl as beautiful as a flowering tree. He rode past Old Iria regularly. He tried stopping in the village at the foot of the hill to ask questions, but there was nowhere to stop and nobody would answer questions. A wall-eyed witch took one look at him and scuttled into her hut. If he went up to the house he would have to face the pack of hellhounds and probably a drunk old man. But it was worth the chance, he thought; he was bored out of his wits with the dull life at Westpool, and was never slow to take a risk. He rode up the hill till the dogs were yelling around him in a frenzy snapping at the mare's legs. She plunged and lashed out her hoofs at them, and he kept her from bolting only by a staying-spell and all the strength in his arms. The dogs were leaping and snapping at his own legs now, and he was about to let the mare have her head when somebody came among the dogs shouting curses and beating them back with a strap. When he got the lathered, gasping mare to stand still, he saw the girl as beautiful as a flowering tree. She was very tall, very sweaty, with big hands and feet and mouth and nose and eyes, and a head of wild dusty hair. She was yelling, "Down! Back to the house, you carrion, you vile sons of bitches!" to the whining, cowering dogs.
Ivory clapped his hand to his right leg. A dog's tooth had ripped his breeches at the calf, and a trickle of blood came through.
"Is she hurt?" the woman said. "Oh, the traitorous vermin!" She was stroking down the mare's right foreleg. Her hands came away covered with blood-streaked horse sweat. "There, there," she said. "The brave girl, the brave heart." The mare put her head down and shivered all over with relief. "What did you keep her standing there in the middle of the dogs for?" the woman demanded furiously. She was kneeling at the horse's leg, looking up at Ivory. He was looking down at her from horseback, yet he felt short; he felt small.
She did not wait for an answer. "I'll walk her up," she said, standing, and put out her hands for the reins. Ivory saw that he was supposed to dismount. He did so, asking, "is it very bad?" and peering at the horse's leg, seeing only bright, bloody foam.
"Come on then, my love," the young woman said, not to him. The mare followed her trustfully. They set off up the rough path round the hillside to an old stone and brick stableyard, empty of horses, inhabited only by nesting swallows that swooped about over the roofs calling their quick gossip.
"Keep her quiet," said the young woman, and left him holding the mare's reins in this deserted place. She returned after some time lugging a heavy bucket, and set to sponging off the mare's leg. "Get the saddle off her," she said, and her tone held the unspoken, impatient, "you fool!" Ivory obeyed, half annoyed by this crude giantess and half intrigued. She did not put him in mind of a flowering tree at all, but she was in fact beautiful, in a large, fierce way. The mare submitted to her absolutely. When she said, "Move your foot!" the mare moved her foot. The woman wiped her down all over, put the saddle blanket back on her, and made sure she was standing in the sun. "She'll be all right," she said. "There's a gash, but if you wash it with warm salt water four or five times a day, it'll heal clean. I'm sorry." She said the last honestly, though grudgingly, as if she still wondered how he could have let his mare stand there to be assaulted, and she looked straight at him for the first time. Her eyes were clear orange-brown, like dark topaz or amber. They were strange eyes, right on a level with his own.
"I'm sorry too," he said, trying to speak carelessly, lightly.
"She's Irian of Westpool's mare. You're the wizard, then?"
He bowed. "Ivory, of Havnor Great Port, at your service. May I -- "
She interrupted. "I thought you were from Roke."
"I am," he said, his composure regained.
She stared at him with those strange eyes, as unreadable as a sheep's, he thought. Then she burst out: "You lived there? You studied there? Do you know the Archmage?"
"Yes," he said with a smile. Then he winced and stooped to press his hand against his shin for a moment.
"Are you hurt too?"
"It's nothing," he said. In fact, rather to his annoyance, the cut had stopped bleeding.
The woman's gaze returned to his face.
"What is it -- what is it like -- on Roke?"
Ivory went, limping only very slightly, to an old mounting-block nearby and sat down on it. He stretched his leg, nursing the torn place, and looked up at the woman. "It would take a long time to tell you what Roke is like," he said. "But it would be my pleasure." 


"What do we have to do?" I asked.
He stood up. He picked up the small lantern he had brought. "First the darkness," he said. I followed him.
We went all the way down the long room, past the shelves where the books I feared were. The lantern gave small light, and I could not see them clearly. Beyond those last shelves the ceiling grew lower, and the light seemed less. I heard the sound of running water clearly now.
The floor had become uneven. Pavement gave way to dirt and rocks. His lame gait grew slower and more cautious.
I saw in the lantern's flickering light a small stream of water that ran from the darkness and dropped down into a deep basin, vanishing underground. We passed the basin and followed beside the water, upstream, on a rocky path. Shadows dodged away from the lantern, quick, huge, and shapeless, running black across raw rock walls. We walked deep into a high tunnel, a long cave. The walls drew closer as we kept walking farther.
The light glittered in the water of a welling spring and trembled reflected on the rock roof above. The Waylord stopped. He raised the lantern, and shadows leapt wildly. He blew it out, and we stood in darkness.
"Bless us and be blessed, spirits of the sacred place," his voice said, low and steady. "We are Sulter Galva of your people and Memer Galva of your people. We come in trust, honoring the sacred, following truth as we are shown it. We come in ignorance, honoring knowledge, asking to know. We come into darkness for light and into silence for words and into fear for blessing. Spirits of this place who made my people welcome, I ask an answer to my question. Will a rebellion, now, against the Alds who hold our city, fail or prevail?"
His voice made no echo off the rock walls. Silence snuffed it out utterly. There was no sound but the faint trickle of the spring, and my breathing, and his. It was absolutely dark. My eyes fooled me again and again, making faint lights flash, and colors blur and vanish in the black in front of me, that sometimes seemed to be right up against my eyes like a blindfold, and then deep and far as a starless sky, so that I feared to fall as if standing on a cliff's edge. Once I thought I saw a glimmer taking form, the shape of a letter, but it went out suddenly, utterly, as a spark goes out. We stood a long time, long enough that I began to feel the rock pressing through my thin shoe soles and the ache in my back from not moving. I was dizzy because there was nothing in the world, no thing at all, only blackness and the sound of water and the pressure of the rock under my feet. No air moved. It was cold. It was still.
I felt warmth, his warmth, a light touch on my arm. We murmured the blessing and turned round. Turning, I became dizzier, disoriented. I didn't know which way I was facing in this utter dark -- had I turned halfway or clear round? I reached out and found him there, the warmth, the touch of the cloth of his sleeve; I took hold of it and followed him. I wondered why he did not light the lantern, but dared not speak. It seemed a long way we went, far longer than the way in. I thought we were going the wrong way, deeper and deeper into the dark. I wouldn't believe it when I first began to see a change, a dimness growing out of darkness ahead of us, not visibility yet but the promise of it. I let go his arm then. But he, lame, took my arm, and held it till we could see our way.
When we were in the room again the space around us was airy and welcoming, and everything was distinct, full of a warm light, even down here at the cave end, the shadow end.
He looked at me searchingly. Then he turned and went to the shelves that had been built where the rock of the cave mouth gave place to plastered wall. Through the plaster here and there a rough cornice of rock stuck out. The shelves were set into the wall, not built out from it. On them were books, some small, some large and coarsely bound, some standing, others lying, maybe fifty or so in all. Some shelves were empty or held only a volume or two. The Waylord looked at the shelves as one does when seeking a book but not certain which or where it is, scanning. He looked again at me.
I looked at once for the white book, the book that had bled. I saw it instantly.
He saw where I was looking. He saw that I could not take my eyes from it. He went forward and took the white book from the shelf.
I stepped back when he did so, I couldn't help it. I said, "Is it bleeding?"
He looked at me, and at the book; he let it fall open gently in his hands.
"No," he said. He held it out to me.
I took another step back from it.
"Can you read it, Memer?"
He turned it and held it out to me again, open. I saw the small, square, white pages. The right-hand page was blank. On the left-hand page there were a few words written small.
I took a hard step forward, and a second step, my hands clenched. I read the words aloud: Broken mend broken.
The sound of my voice was terrible to me, it was not my voice at all but a deep, hollow, echoing sound swelling out all round my head. I cried out, "Put it back, put it away!" and turned and tried to walk back towards the lamp that shone in a sphere of gold far off at the other end of the room, but it was like walking in a dream, I could move my legs only slowly, heavily. He came and took my arm, and together we made our way back. It grew easier for me as we went. We reached the reading table. That was like coming home, coming into firelight out of the night, a haven.
I sat down in the chair with a great, shuddering sigh. He stood a little while stroking my shoulders gently, then went round the table and sat down facing me, as we had been before.
My teeth chattered. I wasn't cold any longer, but my teeth chattered. It was a while before I could make my mouth obey me at all.
"Was that the answer?"
"I don't know," he murmured.
"Was it — was it the oracle?" "Yes."          




“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” This truism is one of the most profound inhibitors of world sharing. This kind of holism is a symptom of agricultural-age monotheism that we are still retweeting, even if we think we are atheists. Its belief format is evident in the way in which Gestalt psychology is misheard to be repeating it. Gestalt psychology argues that the whole is different than its parts, not greater than, yet this common misunderstanding persists among psychologists.
We must find some tools to dismantle it. Why not rewrite holism such that the whole is always less than the sum of its parts? Let’s call it “subscendence.” We’ll go about proving this by examining some features of object-oriented ontology.
We should see things such as humankind as wholes that are less than the sum of their parts. Tim Morton is so many more things than just “human.” A street full of people is much more than just a part of a greater whole called “city.” It’s hard to locate contemporary megacities because we keep looking for something that totally incorporates its parts. Towns, villages, and other formations are strung together in Java in such a way that only the volcanoes on that massive island prevent them from spreading everywhere. The only limit is a perceived threat to life. The string of dwellings isn’t even a megacity, it’s a hypercity, a city that is hardly a city at all. But precisely because of this less-than-a-city quality, a hypercity is beyond even the colossal size we associate with megacities such as Mexico City. Java’s hypercity and Mexico City are less than the sum of their parts. Parts of them—houses, regions of houses—keep on pouring out of them like ice cubes bursting through the paper bag they made wet.
Wholes subscend their parts, which means that parts are not just mechanical components of wholes, and that there can be genuine surprise and novelty in the world, that a different future is always possible. It is good to regard things such as capitalism as physical beings, not simply as fictions that would disappear if we just stopped believing in them. But what kind of physical being are they? If they are subscendent, it means that we can change them, if we want. What if some things could be physically huge, yet ontologically tiny? What if neoliberalism, which envelopes earth in misery, were actually quite small in another way, and thus strangely easy to subvert? Too easy for intellectuals, who want to make everything seem difficult so they can keep themselves in a job by explaining it, or outdo each other in competition for whose picture of the world is more depressing. “I am more intelligent than you because my picture of neoliberalism is far more terrifying and encompassing than yours. We are truly enslaved in my vision, with no hope of escape—therefore I am superior to you!” Isn’t this a tragic consequence of what some call cynical reason, the dominant way of being right for the last two hundred years?
To prove subscendence is also childishly simple, which makes the resistance you will feel toward it all the more significant. To show that the whole is less than the sum of its parts, all you need to do is accept that a group of things can be a thing, which is a simple way of saying that if a thing exists, it exists in the same way as another thing. A sentence exists in the same way as a word-processing program. A tree exists in the same way as a forest. An idea exists in the same way as a quasar. This is very far from saying that things have the same right to exist. Claiming that the AIDS virus has as much right to exist as an AIDS patient is a conclusion you can draw within the logic of deep ecology, but it has nothing to do with actual ecological politics, and everything to do with a Gaia hypothesis or concept of a biosphere that is greater than the sum of its parts, in which every being is a replaceable component. This has to do with agricultural-age religion, the ideological support of the social, psychic, and philosophical machination that eventually generated mass extinction. Deep ecology is fighting fire with fire.
Very well, a tree exists in the same way as a forest. The forest is ontologically one. The trees are more than one. The parts of the forest (the trees—but there are so many more parts in fact) outnumber the whole. This doesn’t mean they “are more important than the whole.” This is the kind of anti-holist reductionism that neoliberalism promotes: “There is no such thing as society; there are only individuals.” We need holism, but a special, weak holism that isn’t theistic.
Climate is ontologically smaller than weather. Weather is a symptom of climate, but there is so much more to weather other than simply being a symptom of climate. A shower of rain is a bath for this bird. It’s a spawning pond for these toads. It’s this soft delicate pattering on my arm. It’s this thing I wrote some sentences about.
Humankind is ontologically smaller than the humans who make it up! There is so much more that humans do other than be parts of humankind. Humans modify their bodies to change their gender and add electronic and decorative prostheses. Humans form relationships with nonhumans. Humans contain nonhumans such as the bacterial microbiome in such a way that if the nonhumans left, the humans would die.
This means that the correct left concept of the human is of a partial object in a set of partial objects, such that it comprises an implosive whole that is less than the sum of its parts. This partiality extends in every dimension, including time. An event is a temporal partial object. An event is part of some set of events that comprises a whole, but this whole is always less than the sum of its parts. A battle in feudal Japan was not simply a matter of two lords fighting. Flies settled on the corpses. Five years later, delicate flowers bloomed. Evolution shuffled the decks in its eons-long game of cards.
To be a thing is to be a perforated bag full of water, in which are swimming countless little perforated bags full of water, in which are floating … When you cut open a bag, so many more bags spill out than you probably bargained for. This is how an emotional label such as “anger” is not (quite evidently) a whole that intuitively contains gradations and subtleties all comprehensively summed up by that one term. We may find within it hesitation, a sense of humor, sexual passion, grief. This is equivalent to discovering that a physical line has a fractal dimensionality when you examine it more closely. A fractal is a partial number that goes wiggling around being just itself for a potential infinity of iterations. Beauty is slightly disgusting or weird or fascinating because the human-scaled bag full of water that is inducing the beauty experience inevitably contains and is part of bags full of water at all kinds of nonhuman scales. Kitsch is subscendent beauty. What Bataille calls “general economy” is a subscendent twelve-inch remix of restricted economy. And what this means is that all the nonhuman economic modes are in the mix too. Economics is really just about how you organize enjoyment. And ecological politics just means allowing and enhancing all kinds of enjoyment that aren’t obviously to do with you. Well, not that they’re nothing to do with you—that’s too tight. It’s just that you let yourself be perforated.
Spectrality means that a being is a symbiotic community consisting of itself and its spectral halo. A being is less than the sum of its parts. Kitsch is other people’s enjoyment. In an ecological age, where there is no one true and proper scale, beauty will be appreciated along with its halo of weirdness or disgust. This kind of beauty is X-beauty, just like a lifeform is always an X-lifeform. Marxism that includes nonhumans is a subscendent X-Marxism, less than the sum of Marxism and anarchism (and so on). Political space that includes nonhumans is X-space that subscends its parts.


Despite what factoids would have us believe, no fact just plops out of the sky. There is a whole environment in which the fact can appear – otherwise you can’t see it at all. Consider something you might not regularly say if you grew up in the West: My ancestral spirits are unhappy that I’m writing this book. In what world does this statement make sense? What do you need to know, what do you need to expect? What counts as right and wrong in this world? We need all kinds of assumptions about what reality is, about what counts as real, what counts as existing, what counts as correct and incorrect. Thinking about these kinds of assumptions can take different forms, in philosophy one is called ontology, another is called epistemology. Ontology is the study of how things exist. Epistemology is the study of how we know things.
In addition to the idea that facts are meaningful within certain contexts of interpretation, there are questions you can answer quite easily if you study art, music or literature. These are questions such as How does the mode want you to read this information? How do you look like you received it ‘right’? You don’t look at a Renaissance perspective painting from the side. You have to stand pretty much right in front of the vanishing point, at a certain distance – then the 3D illusion makes sense. The picture positions you in a certain way, the poem asks to be read a certain way – just like a Coca-Cola bottle ‘wants’ you to hold it a certain way, a hammer seems to fit your hand just so when you handle it . . . A whole lot of what is sometimes called ideology theory is about how you are coerced into handling a poem, a painting, a political speech, a concept in a certain way.
All kinds of ontology and epistemology (and ideology) are implied by ecological information dump mode, but we rarely pause to figure out what they are. We are too keen on dumping, or being dumped on. Why? Why don’t we even seem to want to pause and figure it out? Are we scared we might find something? What are we scared we might find? Why do we wring our hands and go Why don’t these deniers get it? or Why doesn’t my neighbour care about all this as much as I do? Ecological information dump mode is a symptom of something much bigger than feelings about stuff you read in the newspaper.


One way to zoom out and ask these sorts of question again would be to say something like How are we living ecological data? Do we like it? If not, what do we want to do about that? This book, Being Ecological, is about how to live ecological knowledge. It seems to be not enough just to know stuff. In fact, it seems like ‘just knowing stuff’ is never just knowing stuff, according to what I’ve been trying to argue. ‘Just knowing stuff’ is a way of living things too. And knowing that there is a way of living things implies there could be other ways too. If you have tragedy, you can imagine something like comedy. If you live in New York, you can imagine living in not-​New York.
There seem to be plenty of ways of living ecological knowledge. Just think about being a hippy, something with which I am vaguely familiar. Being a hippy is a whole way of life, a whole style. But is being a hippy compulsory as a way to live ecological information? Think about the internet. Before a huge number of people had access to it, there were two or three ways of living with the internet. For instance, there was the amused, playful, experimental, anarchic or libertarian slacker mode in which the internet was supposed to make us feel like our identities were malleable or liquid. Then something strange happened. Loads more people got the internet, and a whole lot of the internet became a really coercive, authoritarian space where you had to have one of about three acceptable opinions or risk being attacked by a mob of judgemental twitterers like the flock descending on the gas station in Alfred Hitchcock’s film The Birds. I’m not going to go into why and how this happened, but you get the point.
Being Ecological is starting by peering under the hood of the ways in which we talk to ourselves about ecology. I think the main way – just dumping data on ourselves – is actually inhibiting a more genuine way of handling ecological knowledge. There are better ways of living all of this than we have now, and we don’t even know that we are living it right now. We are like people caught in a habitual pattern, going along repeating the same thing, without even realizing it. It’s like we find ourselves at the sink, compulsively washing our hands over and over again – but we have no idea how we got there.


What is it that makes humans human? As science and technology challenge the boundaries between life and non-life, between organic and inorganic, this ancient question is more timely than ever. Acclaimed object-oriented philosopher Timothy Morton invites us to consider this philosophical issue as eminently political. In our relationship with nonhumans, we decide the fate of our humanity. Becoming human, claims Morton, actually means creating a network of kindness and solidarity with nonhuman beings, in the name of a broader understanding of reality that both includes and overcomes the notion of species. Negotiating the politics of humanity is the first crucial step in reclaiming the upper scales of ecological coexistence and resisting corporations like Monsanto and the technophilic billionaires who would rob us of our kinship with people beyond our species.


Annapolis, Attica James Bridle “Do you ever feel like you’re living, not in the wrong place, but in the wrong time? Like something occurred, or is going to occur, right here, just down this street, but you’ve missed it or you’re going to miss it and there’s no going back or forwards? Do you get FOMO for the future?”Anna was studying at the Technical University, a visiting scholar. She specialised in remote sensing and urbanism. Something about uncover-ing the patterns of the city using satellites and infrared cameras. She didn’t like talking about it except when she got drunk, and then it was all she could talk about.“FOMO?”“Fear of missing out. But, like, not for right now, but for the future.”I looked up at her. She hadn’t been herself for a while, it felt like. When I met her, back in the summer, she’d been drunk most of the time. So had I. The bars, the beach, the islands. It was a good summer. But when term started again I’d seen less and less of her, snatching the odd cof-fee here and there in the cafeteria, sometimes wandering up to the square for beers. She’d texted me for a drink the month before, and in-sisted on asking me loads of questions about machine learning - some-thing she’d been working on with a partner from another department, closer to mine. I’d explained some of the principles, the lay of the land.“People have been trying to do this for a few decades, but it’s only in the last five they’ve got really good. Massive neural networks, using all the data on the web, and all the processing power on the network. That’s why Facebook and Google are really good at this. They’ve got all of the information and all of the power. Facebook knows what two billion faces look like, and owns six datacentres. Google has three times that num-ber. They’re using neural nets for tagging photos, translating languages, even making music. They’re like electronic brains.”“So you feed in all this information, and the system, like, reads it, and builds a model of what it sees? And then it can make inferences from that model? So if you show it lots of pictures of cats, and lots of pictures of dogs, it can recognise the difference between cats and dogs?”“Yeah, that’s one thing you can do with it. But you can put in any kind of data, not just images. Statistics, designs, formulae, functions - anything you can express in maths, in ones and zeroes. It doesn’t really discrimi-nate.”“But it’s predictive, right?” she asked.“Well, sort of. It can come up with new outputs, but they’re always some variant of what you’ve put in. It can’t just make stuff up, out of nothing.”I got the impression she understood, but she didn’t seem very satisfied.That evening she’d come to Πωλείται with a sheaf of print-outs, big ones, A3 and A2, folded and scored with markings. She’d put them down between us and started drinking. She looked tired and very, very excited at the same time.“So,” she said. “So. We finally got the network running, the big one I told you about.” I didn’t know what she was talking about, and it showed. “You know. The landscape reader.” I blanked, and she grimaced. “Jesus, you must have been drunk. OK.”She started drawing on the empty side of one of the papers. Lines of nodes, circles with letters in them, connected by lines. Arrows going in one side, arrows out the other side. A neural network. Plus little cartoons of satellites and houses.“We’re working with archeology and maths,” she said. “Maths is the col-laborator; archeology is the client. We’ve been looking at aerial maps from before the war, when the air force did a bunch of surveys of the city and the countryside, and then there’s more aerial surveys from the 60s and 70s, and from the 80s onwards you’ve got LandSat, GeoEye, a bunch more satellites coming in. Loads and loads more data. Archeolo-gy are looking for new dig sites, I was looking at the road planning - but I’ve got most of this historical stuff on file. Archeology figured that if we looked at enough of that imagery the right way, we could find new sites. Places that had been overlooked, places only visible from the air.”




Technology is starting to behave in intelligent and unpredictable ways that even its creators don’t understand. As machines increasingly shape global events, how can we regain control?




Something strange has happened to our way of thinking – and as a result, even stranger things are happening to the world. We have come to believe that everything is computable and can be resolved by the application of new technologies. But these technologies are not neutral facilitators: they embody our politics and biases, they extend beyond the boundaries of nations and legal jurisdictions and increasingly exceed the understanding of even their creators. As a result, we understand less and less about the world as these powerful technologies assume more control over our everyday lives.
Across the sciences and society, in politics and education, in warfare and commerce, new technologies are not merely augmenting our abilities, they are actively shaping and directing them, for better and for worse. If we do not understand how complex technologies function then their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and corporations. The results of this can be seen all around us. There is a causal relationship between the complex opacity of the systems we encounter every day and global issues of inequality, violence, populism and fundamentalism.
Instead of a utopian future in which technological advancement casts a dazzling, emancipatory light on the world, we seem to be entering a new dark age characterised by ever more bizarre and unforeseen events. The Enlightenment ideal of distributing more information ever more widely has not led us to greater understanding and growing peace, but instead seems to be fostering social divisions, distrust, conspiracy theories and post-factual politics. To understand what is happening, it’s necessary to understand how our technologies have come to be, and how we have come to place so much faith in them.
The cloud is the central metaphor of the int­ernet: a global system of great power that is almost impossible to grasp
In the 1950s, a new symbol began to creep into the diagrams drawn by electrical engineers to describe the systems they built: a fuzzy circle, or a puffball, or a thought bubble. Eventually, its form settled into the shape of a cloud. Whatever the engineer was working on, it could connect to this cloud, and that’s all you needed to know. The other cloud could be a power system, or a data exchange, or another network of computers. Whatever. It didn’t matter. The cloud was a way of reducing complexity, it allowed you to focus on the issues at hand. Over time, as networks grew larger and more interconnected, the cloud became more important. It became a business buzzword and a selling point. It became more than engineering shorthand; it became a metaphor.


Today the cloud is the central metaphor of the internet: a global system of great power and energy that nevertheless retains the aura of something numinous, almost impossible to grasp. We work in it; we store and retrieve stuff from it; it is something we experience all the time without really understanding what it is. But there’s a problem with this metaphor: the cloud is not some magical faraway place, made of water vapour and radio waves, where everything just works. It is a physical infrastructure consisting of phone lines, fibre optics, satellites, cables on the ocean floor, and vast warehouses filled with computers, which consume huge amounts of water and energy. Absorbed into the cloud are many of the previously weighty edifices of the civic sphere: the places where we shop, bank, socialise, borrow books and vote. Thus obscured, they are rendered less visible and less amenable to critique, investigation, preservation and regulation.


Over the last few decades, trading floors around the world have fallen silent, as people are replaced by banks of computers that trade automatically. Digitisation meant that trades within, as well as between, stock exchangescould happen faster and faster. As trading passed into the hands of machines, it became possible to react almost instantaneously. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms, designed by former physics PhD students to take advantage of millisecond advantages, entered the market, and traders gave them names such as The Knife. These algorithms were capable of eking out fractions of a cent on every trade, and they could do it millions of times a day.


Something deeply weird is occurring within these massively accelerated, opaque markets. On 6 May 2010, the Dow Jones opened lower than the previous day, falling slowly over the next few hours in response to the debt crisis in Greece. But at 2.42pm, the index started to fall rapidly. In less than five minutes, more than 600 points were wiped off the market. At its lowest point, the index was nearly 1,000 points below the previous day’s average, a difference of almost 10% of its total value, and the biggest single-day fall in the market’s history. By 3.07pm, in just 25 minutes, it recovered almost all of those 600 points, in the largest and fastest swing ever.

In the chaos of those 25 minutes, 2bn shares, worth $56bn, changed hands. Even more worryingly, many orders were executed at what the Securities Exchange Commission called “irrational prices”: as low as a penny, or as high as $100,000. The event became known as the “flash crash”, and it is still being investigated and argued over years later.


One report by regulators found that high-frequency traders exacerbated the price swings. Among the various HFT programs, many had hard-coded sell points: prices at which they were programmed to sell their stocks immediately. As prices started to fall, groups of programs were triggered to sell at the same time. As each waypoint was passed, the subsequent price fall triggered another set of algorithms to automatically sell their stocks, producing a feedback effect. As a result, prices fell faster than any human trader could react to. While experienced market players might have been able to stabilise the crash by playing a longer game, the machines, faced with uncertainty, got out as quickly as possible.


Computation is increasingly layered across, and hidden within, every object in our lives, and with its expansion comes an increase in opacity and unpredictability. One of the touted benefits of Samsung’s line of “smart fridges” in 2015 was their integration with Google’s calendar services, allowing owners to schedule grocery deliveries from the kitchen. It also meant that hackers who gained access to the then inadequately secured machines could read their owner’s Gmail passwords. Researchers in Germany discovered a way to insert malicious code into Philips’s wifi-enabled Hue lightbulbs, which could spread from fixture to fixture throughout a building or even a city, turning the lights rapidly on and off and – in one possible scenario – triggering photosensitive epilepsy. This is the approach favoured by Byron the Bulb in Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, an act of grand revolt by the little machines against the tyranny of their makers. Once-fictional possibilities for technological violence are being realised by the Internet of Things.


We are able to record every aspect of our daily lives by attaching technology to the surface of our bodies, persuading us that we too can be optimised and upgraded like our devices. Smart bracelets and smartphone apps with integrated step counters and galvanic skin response monitors track not only our location, but every breath and heartbeat, even the patterns of our brainwaves. Users are encouraged to lay their phones beside them on their beds at night, so that their sleep patterns can be recorded. Where does all this data go, who owns it, and when might it come out? Data on our dreams, our night terrors and early morning sweating jags, the very substance of our unconscious selves, turn into more fuel for systems both pitiless and inscrutable.
Or perhaps the flash crash in reality looks exactly like everything we are experiencing right now: rising economic inequality, the breakdown of the nation-state and the militarisation of borders, totalising global surveillance and the curtailment of individual freedoms, the triumph of transnational corporations and neurocognitive capitalism, the rise of far-right groups and nativist ideologies, and the degradation of the natural environment. None of these are the direct result of novel technologies, but all of them are the product of a general inability to perceive the wider, networked effects of individual and corporate actions accelerated by opaque, technologically augmented complexity.


Everyone is familiar with the sorts of jobs whose purpose is difficult to discern: HR consultants, PR researchers, communications coordinators, financial strategists, logistics managers. The list is endless. This is how Kurt, a subcontractor for the German military, describes his job:“The German military has a subcontractor that does its IT work. The IT firm has a subcontractor that does its logistics. The logistics firm has a subcontractor that does its personnel management. I work for that company. “Let’s say a soldier moves to an office two rooms down the hall. Instead of carrying his computer over, he fills out a form. The IT subcontractor reads and approves it and forwards it to the logistics firm. The logistics firm approves the move and requests personnel from us. I get an email to travel to the barracks. The barracks are up to three hundred miles away from my home, so I rent a car. I drive to the barracks, fill out a form, unhook the computer, load it into a box, and seal the box. A guy from the logistics firm carries the box to the new office. There, I unseal the box, fill out another form, hook up the computer, get a few signatures, drive back home, send a letter with the paperwork, and then I get paid.”In 2015, YouGov, a polling agency, asked Brit-ons whether they believed their job made a “meaningful contribution to the world.” More than a third—37 percent—believed it did not. (Only 50 percent said that it did; 13 percent were uncertain.) A more recent poll conducted in the Netherlands found that 40 percent of Dutch workers felt their job had no good reason to exist.Our society values work. We expect a job to serve a purpose and to have a larger meaning. For workers who have internalized this value system, there is little that is more demoralizing than waking up five days a week to perform a task that one believes is a waste of time.It’s not obvious, however, why having a pointless job makes people quite so miserable. After all, a large portion of the workforce is being paid—often very good money—to do nothing. They might consider themselves fortunate. Instead, many feel worthless and depressed.


In 1901, the German psychologist Karl Groos discovered that infants express extraordinary understanding of the formation of the self, and of human motivation more generally. Children come to see that they exist as distinct individuals who are separate from the world around them by observing that they can cause something to happen, and happen again. Crucially, the realization brings a de-light, the pleasure at being the cause, that is the very foundation of our being.Experiments have shown that if a child is allowed to experience this delight but then is suddenly denied it, he will become enraged, refuse to engage, or even withdraw from the world entirely. The psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Fran-cis Broucek suspected that such traumatic experiences can cause many mental health issues later in life. His research led him to devise a theory of play as make-believe: Adults invent games and diversions for the same reason that an infant delights in his ability to move a pencil. We wish to exercise our powers as an end in themselves. What freedom is — the ability to make things up for the sake of being able to do so.The make-believe aspect of the work is precisely what performers of bullshit jobs find the most infuriating. Just about anyone in a supervised wage-labor job finds it maddening to pretend to be busy. Working is meant to serve a purpose—if make-believe play is an expression of human freedom, then make-believe work imposed by others represents a total lack of freedom. It’s unsurprising, then, that the first historical occurrence of the notion that some people ought to be working at all times, or that work should be made up to fill their time even in the absence of things that need doing, concerns workers who are not free: prisoners and slaves.
Historically, human work patterns have taken the form of intense bursts of energy followed by rest. Farming, for instance, is generally an all-hands-on-deck mobilization around planting and harvest, with the off-seasons occupied by minor projects. Large projects such as building a house or preparing for a feast tend to take the same form. This is typical of how human beings have always worked. There is no reason to believe that acting otherwise would result in greater efficiency or productivity. Often it has precisely the opposite effect.One reason that work was historically irregular is because it was largely unsupervised. This is true of medieval feudalism and of most labor arrangements until relatively recent times, even if the relationship between worker and boss was strikingly unequal. If those at happiness when they first discover their ability to cause predictable effects in the world. For example, they might scribble with a pencil by randomly moving their arms and hands. When they realize that they can achieve the same result by retracing the same pattern, they respond with expressions of utter joy. Groos called this “the pleasure at being the cause,” and suggested that it was the basis for play.Before Groos, most Western political philosophers, economists, and social scientists assumed that humans seek power out of either a desire for conquest and domination or a practical need to guarantee physical gratification and reproductive success. Most societies throughout history would never have imagined that a person’s time could be-long to his employer. But today it is considered perfectly natural for free citizens of democratic countries to rent out a third or more of their day. “I’m not paying you to lounge around,” reprimands the modern boss, with the outrage of a man who feels he’s being robbed. How did we get here?By the fourteenth century, the common understanding of what time was had changed; it became a grid against which work was measured, rather than the work itself be-ing the measure. Clock towers funded by local merchant guilds were erected throughout Europe. These same merchants placed human skulls on their desks as memento mori, to remind themselves that they should make quick use of their time. The proliferation of domestic clocks and pocket watches that coincided with the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the late eighteenth century allowed for a similar attitude toward time to spread among the middle class. Time came to be widely seen as a finite property to be budgeted and spent, much like money. And these new time-telling devices allowed a worker’s time to be chopped up into uniform units that could be bought and sold. Factories started to require workers to punch the time clock upon entering and leaving.The change was moral as well as technological. One began to speak of spending time rather than just passing it, and also of wasting time, killing time, saving time, losing time, racing against time, and so forth. Over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, an episodic style of working was increasingly treated as a social problem. Methodist preachers exhorted “the husbandry of time”; time management became the essence of morality. The poor were blamed for spending their time recklessly, for being as irresponsible with their time as they were with their money.Workers protesting oppressive conditions, meanwhile, adopted the same notions of time. Many of the first factories didn’t allow workers to bring in their own timepieces, be-cause the owner played fast and loose with the factory clock. Labor activists negotiated higher hourly rates, demanded fixed-hour contracts, overtime, time and a half, twelve- and then eight-hour work shifts. The act of demanding “free time,” though understand.


The idea that workers have a moral obligation to allow their working time to be dictated has become so normalized that members of the public feel indignant if they see, say, transit workers lounging on the job. Thus busywork was invented: to ameliorate the supposed problem of workers not having enough to do to fill an eight-hour day. Take the experience of a woman named Wendy, who sent me a long history of pointless jobs she had worked:“As a receptionist for a small trade magazine, I was often given tasks to perform while waiting for the phone to ring. Once, one of the ad- sales people dumped thousands of paper clips on my desk and asked me to sort them by color. She then used them interchangeably.“Another example: my grandmother lived independently in an apartment in New York City into her early nineties, but she did need some help. We hired a very nice woman to live with her, help her do shopping and laundry, and keep an eye out in case she fell or needed help. So, if all went well, there was nothing for this woman to do. This drove my grandmother crazy. ‘She’s just sitting there!’ she would complain. Ultimately, the woman quit.”This sense of obligation is common across the world. Ramadan, for example, is a young Egyptian engineer working for a public enterprise in Cairo.The company needed a team of engineers to come in every morning and check whether the air conditioners were working, then hang around in case something broke. Of course, management couldn’t admit that; instead, the firm invented forms, drills, and box-ticking rituals calculated to keep the team busy for eight hours a day. “I discovered immediately that I hadn’t been hired as an engineer at all but really as some kind of technical bureaucrat,” Ramadan explained. “All we do here is paperwork, filling out checklists and forms.” Fortunately, Ramadan gradually figured out which ones nobody would notice if he ignored and used the time to indulge a growing interest in film and literature. Still, the process left him feeling hollow. “Going every workday to a job that I considered pointless was psychologically exhausting and left me depressed.”The end result, however exasperating, doesn’t seem all that bad, especially since Ramadan had figured out how to game the system. Why couldn’t he see it, then, as stealing back time that he’d sold to the corporation? Why did the pretense and lack of purpose grind him down?A bullshit job—where one is treated as if one were usefully employed and forced to play along with the pretense—is inherently demoralizing because it is a game of make-believe not of one’s own making. Of course the soul cries out. It is an assault on the very foundations of self. A human being unable to have a meaningful impact on the world ceases to exist.
I’m intrigued by the rocks. Do you give slingshots? No, we have some people who have pretty good arms. They can chuck a rock pretty fast. english: Did you consider any other non lethal methods, such as rubber bullets? helsel: Obviously the teachers have pepper spray. The rocks are just for students. We used to have them huddle underneath desks. We’ve learned from Virginia Tech: the gentle-man that did it went to a shooting range a week before and put the targets on the ground because he knew students were going to be under the desks. The idea is we have rocks. Some people have golf balls. But golf balls bounce around. I was afraid of collateral damage with our kids, so I thought, the rocks won’t bounce. We had a dump truck go over to a landscaper and get river stone. They’re nice, they’re smooth, and you can hurl them pretty quickly, and hard. I commend your practical thinking.
                                                        


Hans Ulrich Obrist: To begin with the beginning, I wanted to ask you to tell us how it all started, if you had an epiphany or a revelation. How did you come to philosophy — or how did philosophy come to you?
Timothy Morton1: [Laughter] It came to me actually. Well I trained as an English Literature guy, and I trained in the era of Historicism, and Historicism meant, you know, you’ve got to go to the library and look for lots of books in the archive. And then about maybe five years later I started thinking, ‘Well what kinds of books do I want to read actually?’ and that made me go a bit more philosophical. And I’d always been very attuned to literary theory; one of my strong points was reading that and understanding that, and literary theory is really just a very small, narrow bandwidth of continental philosophy, yes? And then I’d been wanting to write this book about ecology, something about it, since the late eighties, and I just couldn’t find a good way to write what I wanted to write. And eventually, after about, I don’t know, ten–twelve years of thinking it through I found a way of doing it, and so I started doing that and it turns out to be quite philosophical, but I didn’t really think of myself that way. Funnily enough it was Gary Snyder, you know? Yes, I used to have his job, he left University of California and I took his job — sorry Gary! And then he read one of these books that I’d just done and he said, ‘You know what? This is a philosophy book,’ and I was like, ‘Oh, alright,’ you know? So I’m in a fortunate position actually because I didn’t train as a philosopher, so when people put me on stage and they’re all like, ‘Oh, do something philosophical in front of us,’ I’m not really that inhibited from doing something, and it’s sort of like the generosity of other people, they see me that way, and that’s good too because… I don’t have a lot of ego caught up in that.
  Now in relation to that, I was also interested in the surrounding philosophical context, because your work has been often seen in Europe in connection with object oriented ontology or speculative realism, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this. And how do you feel that object oriented ontology in particular is urgent for the world we live in today?
  Oh sure, yes. Well, it all started with Immanuel Kant who I believe is the first really modern philosopher, who is actually coincident with the beginning of the Anthropocene, he did all of his stuff in the late eighteenth century, and the thing about him is that he basically says that there are things — but you can’t access them directly. And what object-oriented ontology is saying is that. There are things, you can’t access them directly. It’s just that there’s a kind of anthropocentric copyright control on who gets to access, right? And it turns out to be us lot. And once you get rid of the copyright control and once you get rid of Kant’s nervous restriction on what access means; access for him is mathematizing philosophy, like everything is just extension and so if I know things mathematically I know them extensionally, right? If you take that away and, you know, a raindrop touching me, I’m also accessing it. I’m having a feeling about it, that’s also accessing it. So if you take that away and you take the anthropocentric block, inhibition, away, what you get is that everything in the universe gets to access everything else, and the way that everything accesses everything is such that nothing is ever exhausted, everything is always completely sparkling with some kind of unfathomable, vivid, bristly reality, you know? And ultimately that’s funny, it’s like it’s a comedy, it’s not a tragedy, it’s not horrific. There are these other speculative realists who are quite interested in sort of, ‘Ah!’, Home Alone face kind of, the horror sort of stuff, and I think no, that’s actually not right, the tragedy thing is actually deeply caught up in the ecological problem thing, and fundamentally reality is an anarchy, so we better get used to having some kind of sense that there’s no top level way of proceeding. And that actually at bottom everything is playful, like everything is a toy, including political systems, political systems are also toys, and economic systems are also toys. So let’s have lots and lots of toys. And I think one of the problems we’ve been in, and it’s a problem we’ve been in for twelve thousand years, is a problem of thinking that there’s this kind of one size fits all toy that isn’t a toy anymore, it’s reality. And it’s this kind of agricultural, logistical approach to agriculture where there’s this mentality or philosophy kind of hard-wired into it. Existing is always better than any quality of existing, and existing means not contradicting yourself. So let’s get rid of all the weeds and the pests, let’s label those as bad things, and let’s have… Nature is over there and human society goes over there, and moo cows are there, and don’t look at the cats because they’re distracting us from this thin, rigid boundary, and let’s police it, and let’s have a really thin one-year-wide temporality window, or five years if you’re a Soviet, right? You know, capitalism, feudalism, communism, whatever, it’s all based on this model of agriculture that developed in the Fertile Crescent and also in Latin America and Asia around that time, and we’ve been inside it and so have all the other life forms. And very successfully and efficiently, based on the philosophy that’s hard-wired in there, we have managed to cause the sixth mass extinction event, and if we don’t want to carry that on we might be interested in developing something that doesn’t do that, and that means having, first of all, lots and lots of different ways, lots and lots of different political systems, there’s no one umbrella way, and it means really accepting a different philosophical view according to which, things aren’t just lumps of [makes a sound to indicate something nameless and indefinable] waiting for me to decide what they are because I’m a human, goo goo g’joob, ‘I’m the Walrus, I can turn anything into anything, everything is a urinal, if I sign it’—that’s the art theory version, right—‘if I sign it with my signature it’s art’, right? ‘Everything is just plastic waiting for me to manipulate.’ And we need to have a different view which is this view that things are intrinsically what they are from their own side, they don’t need us, and they’re kind of alive because they’re sparkling with appearance in some kind of trixie kind of… I don’t know what to say, trixie sort of way.


  Now obviously for the Extinction Marathon — and you already mentioned the sixth extinction — your two books that you initially mentioned are particularly relevant, they are Ecology Without Nature and The Ecological Thought, which have in a way infused the contemporary philosophical current with a very strong ecological viewpoint. Of course also your concept of hyperobjects — philosophy and ecology also are part of that. So I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit about how you arrived at those positions and how ecology played such an important role along the way?
  Oh sure. Well ecology is very simple, it means the interconnection of all life forms, and indeed the interconnection of all those life forms with non life, and you know, where do you draw the line? And where do you stop? Do you stop at the edge of the biosphere, because you need the magnetic shield around Earth and then you need the sun obviously, which then implies the solar system which implies the galaxy, you can’t really stop when you start thinking about it. So it’s not a complete holistic thing, unlike what a lot of people think ecology is, it means thinking something that is boundless, yes? Everything’s related but it’s boundless, there’s no centre and there’s no edge. So there’s no centre, there’s no edge, and there’s no one dominant top level, or there’s no one fundamental bottom level, and there’s no middle level. And so I started thinking, ‘What does that mean?’ And in part it means that in a way there’s weirdly less of everything than you thought; it’s kind of like if you start to look after the bunny rabbits it means that you’re not looking after the bunny rabbit parasites. Interconnection implies that you can never it right, you can never get ecological ethics and politics right. And it also means that you become aware of these entities, entities that are not human, some of them we made, some of them we just encounter through our scientific instruments. And you can think them but you can’t see them, you can’t touch them, and these are the hyperobjects. And one of them of course is the biosphere. You can see bunnies, you can see Hans Ulrich, but you can’t see the biosphere. Nevertheless it’s real and it has some kind of downward causality on bunnies and Hans Ulrich. So you can think it but you can’t see or touch it, it lasts for a very long time, it’s massively bigger than you in space time terms, it out-scales you, and this is what I’m calling a hyperobject. And there are all these other hyperobjects, like global warming, you know, it’s not just data, it’s a thing, it’s a very high dimensional thing that you can’t see as a limited 3-D human being, you need… Some of the most powerful computers on Earth can just about model it in real time. So you can’t really see it, you can’t really touch it, but it’s real and you can sort of feel it in the weather but it isn’t the weather, you know? And whether you like it or not, so whatever Rush Limbaugh says about it, his head cares about global warming, doesn’t it? Because he puts on the sunscreen probably so he doesn’t get the skin cancer because he knows the sun… And so no matter what you think about it, it’s there. And pollution, radiation, like nuclear radiation, the plutonium half-life is 24.1 thousand years, and what do we do now that we realize we’re inside and we are part of these things? Like human species actually, if you want to think the human species, in a non-racist, non-speciesist way, like, ‘Oh look, there’s a species and I can distinguish it from that one,’ you have to think of the species as a hyperobject, and you are it but you aren’t, right? And it’s really uncanny. Like you start the engine of your car, and I personally, I have no motivation there to destroy Earth, nor am I doing so because statistically me starting that engine is meaningless, but when you scale it up to mean billions of car ignitions billions of times in billions of cars across the whole earth, that’s exactly what’s happening, it’s kind of like being in one of those movies when you realize, ‘Oh my God, I’m an android,’ you know, like, ‘I’m a zombie. I thought I had free will but on this other level I’m just this zombie blindly executing this algorithm.’ So that’s what’s uncanny about it, and so ecological awareness, maybe the beginning of it, is a feeling of weirdness and uncanny, although I don’t think we should stay there at all because I think it gets a bit voyeuristic and violent, sort of misogynistic, if you stay there.


  Now the hyperobject, as you told us, is something — a concept or event — that manifests itself in such a distributive way that we can’t apprehend it. I was interested in knowing a little bit more because Michel Serres told me in our recent interview about his idea of the quasiobject, so I was curious if there is any link between the hyperobject and the quasiobject; and also if you would consider extinction to be a hyperobject?
  Well, first of all perhaps I should say the most important thing: I’m not the object police, so my job isn’t to say, ‘Yes, that is an object,’ you know, like, ‘This is an object, and that, and that isn’t.’ I can’t do that, but I don’t want to dodge the question, that’s not what I’m trying to do, it’s just that I’m the person who says, ‘How things exist is like this,’ rather than, ‘This is what exists’. Nevertheless, I’m interested in how Serres and also [Bruno] Latour. Latour’s got this idea of quasi objects as well. And it seems like people are trying to think beings that aren’t as cookie-cutter as they used to be. Like we gave up on ontology a while ago because we thought it was medieval and rude and wrong, but all of a sudden the new ecological conditions demand that we think what it is for things to exist. And so I would say that Serres’ idea and Latour’s idea and my idea are really just speaking to the fact that all of a sudden things don’t seem to be what they used to be. It’s not your grandfather’s kind of object, well it’s not my grandfather’s kind of object. And it’s much weirder; I see these things as basically looped, they’re weird, weird comes from this, it comes from this Icelandic word ortt [?sp] which means twisted in a loop, we won’t talk about that right now. So extinction, well I think species is a hyperobject, I think intuitively extinction is the disappearance of those species, and what makes that like a hyperobject is that I can’t directly see it. I can see the bear that I take to be the last bear of the species dying, but I can’t see the species’ death, right? And I think since extinction is a term that applies to species I’m going to say no, maybe extinction is not a hyperobject, but extinction is a feature of what makes a species into an object, which is fragility. Every entity in order to exist has to be able to die, and that means that every entity contains some kind of weak spot, some kind of place where… Some kind of other appearance could insert itself. I take appearance to be the way the causality lives—wow, there’s a huge thunderstorm about to happen, everything’s gone really dark, talking of hyperobjects—and I take that to mean that species are not these solid, hard things that the Greeks, like Aristotle, thought they were, they are also fragile, they’re finite. We think of these things as really big, and if you were a Marxist you’d be like, ‘Oh Professor Morton, you’re making a really universalistic generalization there, shame on you, you’re kind of doing a Pink Floyd when you’re saying there are these things called species,’ well yes, but I’m not really making a generalization, I’m saying that there are these huge entities and you can’t see them or touch them, and they’re not infinite, they’re huge.


  Now just to finish on the topic of extinction: Gustav Metzger for many years has encouraged us to do a Marathon on extinction because he says that with climate change nobody really wakes up and we need to talk about extinction in order to have a real call for action. I just wanted your reaction to the theme of extinction for the Marathon and to the idea of an Extinction Marathon.
  Yes. Well a marathon is something you do when something’s… You’re losing. Sorry, I’m going to get upset. Last week it was revealed that 50% of animals, fish and you and stuff, actually have gone extinct. I thought it was going to be 32%, it’s actually 50%. And I think it’s really OK to be upset about it, and it’s OK to go into that and try and find some kind of exit route inside the upset, and maybe the Marathon sort of speaks to that, doesn’t it? Because marathons are run out of desperation; you know, you’ve got the soldier desperately trying to convey something, has to run 26 miles putting his life at risk, and it’s painful, you have bare feet, you have to run over these rocks, and maybe your sandals have got shredded, and so on and so on, and it’s very risky, and it also means that you are also an animal, you’re running, which is what human beings do. Human beings, funnily enough, as a species, well what are we good at? It’s not actually thinking that makes us distinct, it’s sweating and running, those are the two things that actually are quite distinct, quite unique in a way, about humans as a high primate. And the thing about extinction right now is that so many more life forms have just become extinct than we thought, so this Marathon couldn’t be happening at a more important time. And it’s exhausting, and it goes on and on and on, marathons; this thing that we’re in called ecology, it just goes on and on, right? I don’t see an end to this awareness, you can’t switch it off. And now that we have it we’re thinking on 100 year, 1,000 year, 10,000 year, 100,000 year time scales, and that’s really freaky, there’s no one top time scale anymore. So we’re really disoriented and we have to keep running, and it’s like that first marathon guy, you know. And we can’t just be sitting in our chair going, ‘Hmm, I wonder what this means,’ we’re completely caught in it, no matter whether we’re thinking or moving or acting or whatever. And I personally think that philosophy should be able to cry and laugh, because otherwise why on earth would you do it?
  Such a wonderful statement. Now I was interested also in you actually mentioning Blade Runner and Frankenstein, which obviously brings us to the question of the posthuman. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the future — because obviously the Extinction Marathon raises also the question of the future — and if you think that we’re working towards a posthuman world. Do you think that the evolution of technology interacts with queer ecological positions? So just hearing more about visions of the future would be great.


  Sure. That’s where it all gets a bit funny, doesn’t it? Because we think we know what that is and we’re very good at imagining it; being modern human is about imagining all kinds of futures, isn’t it? And I’d like to say before I start that those kinds of imaginable, plannable, predictable futures are predicated on what you could call the ‘future future’, the strange future future, you know, like this irreducibly future future. This is my friend Jacques Derrida. I can’t let go of deconstruction. There’s a future future that you can’t determine, that you can’t predict, and so part of the struggle to colonize the future with thoughts and hypothetical technologies and so on is a kind of violence to that future. I’m not saying, ‘Let’s just do nothing,’ I’m saying, ‘Obviously do everything you can, except Professor Tim is going to say, ‘Please don’t geoengineer the heck out of Earth,’’ because if that’s what technology means that’s kind of just modernity 2.0 which is this agricultural meme, 7.0, a total destruction mode, and it’s like doubling down on the kind of mentality that got us in the first place which is the tragic hero’s attempt to escape from the web of fate, right? That’s the kind of self-transcending, you know, ‘I can be bigger than myself because I’m modern, rah rah rah, and I can pull myself up by my own bootstraps, and I can achieve escape velocity from Earth,’ and the kind of modern philosophy, like, ‘I am now talking to you from a partition outside of reality, everything is one,’ and that kind of stuff. Or, ‘There is nothing,’ that’s the most popular one, isn’t it? Number one in the charts, Nihilism. And so I’m pretty freaked about doing that, let’s not do that, OK, because that’s just doing the modern thing again, only once more with feeling. And so I think technology, what does it really mean? Technology, like engineers make toys, don’t they, before they become products? Before the corporation decides, ‘Oh, that toy’s the toy that’s going to make the money so let’s make that toy into a product,’ they make prototypes. And artists do paintings and probably they don’t think, ‘This is the definitive one.’ If they’re like me writing books they probably think, ‘Oh thank God, that’s not the perfect one, there is no perfect one, and I just have to keep going.’ And so art objects are toys and poems are toys and songs are toys and interpretations are toys. And philosophical views are toys; we talk about making toy worlds all the time. So I think instead of saying what to make, I think I should be saying, ‘Let’s have the mentality of making toys, little toys, playful toys, that aren’t going to be… There’s no one toy to rule them all, you just can’t have that. And so let’s make a world of toys,’ because actually ontologically we are in a realm called the realm of toys I believe. I think that’s what happens when you have enough ecological awareness, you realize that you’re in a world that is necessarily incomplete. And what do toys do, actual toys? They connect humans and non-humans, right? So I’m playing with this Barbie doll and I can pull her head off and stick Darth Vader’s head on and enjoy that, and invite my friend, and oh look, the cat’s playing with it. And so that’s what toys do, and they always connect… Not totally, you can’t connect every single being, and that speaks to something about ecological ethics, such that interdependence means you can’t save all of it all at once, there’s a kind of sad but also funny, hilarious, ridiculous, sad quality to that where you cannot save every single thing all in one go, and the feeling of that is actually the feeling of compassion, which has some kind of joy and laughter in it rather than this, ‘Oh vey, let’s put a Band-Aid on everything,’ kind of approach. So that would be my sense, let’s make toys because we can’t predict the future, and if we have the mentality of making toys on every level, toy political systems, toy… Like I’m getting together with the engineers here and we’ve got this thing called The Design (Coach), and me and a couple of other philosophers were like, ‘Let’s tell you something to make for, like, 300 years from now’. Because they’re all bound by corporation temporality so they’re really happy to do things, like, ‘Let’s make an object that might be helpful 10,000 years into the future,’ right? That’s a kind of ecological technology toy making thing.
  Now from toys, because that’s very, very interesting as it also evokes the question of the toolbox… the idea that one could actually provide toolboxes. Is the analogy of toys somehow connected to the toolbox?
  Sure, what’s on your mind there?
  I was just wondering because it was Foucault who talked about the idea of philosophy being a toolbox. He said “I would like my books to be a kind of tool-box which others can rummage through to find a tool which they can use however they wish in their own area… I would like the little volume that I want to write on disciplinary systems to be useful to an educator, a warden, a magistrate, a conscientious objector. I don’t write for an audience, I write for users, not readers.” I was just wondering if when you think about toys, if we can connect the toy analogy to the toolbox analogy.
  Yes. Sure, yes. As I get older I find that I’m actually kind of an early seventies French feminist funnily enough, and I find that I am like one of those people like [Jean-François] Lyotard or [Luce] Irigaray for whom totalization is the big enemy, only unlike Lyotard it’s not just epistemological. And I think maybe Foucault is a little bit coming from a kind of epistemological place, like, ‘Ontology is a thing that might be part of the evil empire of epistemic dispositifs that control us,’ you know? And so saying what things are might be tantamount to something oppressive. But I think ultimately we are in a reality and we have to talk about it, and it’s kind of like a war, like it’s a magic war, with magicians and witches, and we’re all involved in this higher level sort of war about the nature of reality actually and how to care for it, all of us, not just philosophers: artists, people, cats, dogs, cities. And so yes, I think in a way it’s like the toolbox, although I suspect the toolbox is more an epistemological toolbox than an ontological toolbox; I’m actually saying, ‘Get this piece of plastic and connect it to this piece of leather, and then make this other thing that looks a bit like Kermit the Frog and then join that together with some group over here, and then let’s form this solidarity with these other life forms,’ and that kind of business. Where there’s less of an emphasis on getting the attitude right, you know? I think that’s maybe a hangover from the kind of postmodern… Not Foucault in particular, but just the general vibe of how it’s worked, even in the last 200 years, not just in postmodernism, the whole approach of art, like ‘If we just get the attitude right then everything will work,’ ‘If I just paint these cubes everything will come out alright,’ you know, ‘If I just think everything is a urinal everything will be good,’ you know? But everything isn’t a urinal. Everything is, like, a frog or a glass of milk or a saucepan or a TV or a staircase or Hans Ulrich, right? So you can’t just keep on tweaking your concept, you can’t say, ‘If I open the refrigerator correctly I will see the light in the best possible way,’ it’s like by the time you get there the fridge already melted all the ice cream. And it’s the same with the Earth, it’s like by the time you get the attitude right of why to save it and what it is, it’s already gone, so we’re in this position where there’s a kind of immediacy where we’re making these things, but that doesn’t mean, ‘Just do it,’ in this kind of anti-intellectual, Proto-fascist way, it’s more like as you make these toys you’re more like, ‘Wow, this is not my beautiful toy, this is not my beautiful biosphere.’
  I have some final questions about queer ecology. I wanted to ask you one thing about… — because you mentioned Lyotard, and it’s actually not so much to do with extinction but something else we’re working on at the moment, this research together with Daniel Birnbaum on Lyotard’s unrealized exhibition. Because Lyotard at a certain moment did an exhibition called Les Immatériaux, and it took place in the Centre Georges Pompidou. I don’t know if you saw that show, it was in the eighties?
  I didn’t, but you know, I am very attracted to the kinds of work that was going on at the Centre Georges Pompidou in the eighties.
  Yes, and he basically devoted — instead of writing a book — a year or more of his work to do this exhibition, and it was all about the loss of the subject. So it was about deconstruction, dematerialization, and the beginning of the internet: basically about immateriality and going away from the body. And it’s very interesting because Philip Parreno — the artist who also adores your writing — towards the end of his time at school, had a lecture. Lyotard visited that small group of artists and had a conversation with them, and Lyotard revealed there that actually he wanted to do an exhibition which somehow was almost the opposite of Les Immatériaux; he wanted to do an exhibition called Resistance where he would look into this idea of the inexhaustible, into this idea of what resistance could be. But in a way almost like the other way around: so it’s not that one would have the subject at the beginning and then the non-subject, but it would sort of be the opposite. And in a way I always thought that that idea of resistance seemed very interesting, of course not only politically… also he wanted to connect it to the electrical circuit. It was all part of that idea of transcending the book, no? Deleuze had the same interest — they wanted to transcend the book and go into exhibitions. I wanted to ask you two things: first of all, what resonates with you in that notion of resistance or resistances? Yes, let’s stick to that first: what resonates for you in this notion of resistances?
  Sure, resistances. Well I associate it a little bit with Foucault’s idea that the more resistance you have the more power; it’s like an electrical circuit where the resistor actually ramps up the power of that circuit. And so when I think of resistance I think of wanting to have a category for acting and making things that isn’t quite resistance and is more like, like I say, play, which I know is another Lyotard concept. And then I wonder… Remind me, this is the phase of Lyotard where he becomes this weird humanist, is that why he’s using this term resistance? He wants to resist the onslaught of a certain kind of technology, like in The Inhuman book?
  Yes, it could almost be like his return to Heidegger — that’s the thing we are not sure — because at the same time it’s also the book where Lyotard wrote his book Discourse, Figure where in a way there is this irreducible visual dimension which is obviously the base for language, but at the same time there is no fusion, there is a permanent conflict between discourse and figure. And that book has just been translated, I think. It’s quite interesting. It’s one of his last, quite mysterious books. So it goes hand in hand with this and with that sort of mysterious, almost inexplicable return to Heidegger, I suppose.
  Well I think that where my mind first goes with it is the question of the problem with Heidegger actually, there are a lot of problems with Heidegger. And maybe one of the problems is, although of course my view is kind of like upside-down Heidegger a little bit, one of the problems is that he’s still writing within a kind of agrilogistical—I’m calling it agrilogistical—frame, that’s this 10–12,000 year frame, which has kind of set what social reality is and therefore what ecology is, and therefore what extinction means for the last 10–12,000 years. And I think that that kind of resistance isn’t quite the right way of proceeding I don’t think. When I hear that I hear maybe the kind of primitivistic side of things, and it’s funny because I could be misheard as saying, ‘Let’s just… Like John Zerzan, kind of radical ecoanarchy violence, ‘Let’s bomb everything back to 12,000 BC, everyone with glasses is now suspect, all prosthetic devices must be burned, because the problem is loops and we’re all self-reflexive and up ourselves with our narcissistic loops and that’s bad.’ And then there’s the other way of getting it wrong which is kind of like, ‘Well of course I’m actually advocating that we go back to a state of peaceful coexistence with life forms in a non-coercive manner where we didn’t impose this agricultural thing on the rest of Earth, that would be absurd,’ and it’s kind of like what happens in theory class where you’re supposed to say, ‘Well of course I’m not a biological essentialist, that would be beyond the pale,’ you know, you’re supposed to make this pre-theoretical statement as a kind of condition of getting through the door and not looking like an idiot. You have to say, ‘Well of course I don’t believe that there are leaves and prime ministers and ducks and whatever, they’re all just effects of something else, the discursive formation, transcendental subject, la langue,’ I don’t know what, ‘(geiss, dasein),’ you know, ‘Will, will to power, human economic relations,’ you know, ‘Of course they are ducks, but they’re not ‘ducks’ ducks because I’m the decider.’ So I think that both of those are wrong. I think what it is more than resistance for me is knowing, knowing something that’s already there, knowing in a loop actually; in some spiritual traditions it’s called gnosis, in Buddhism it’s jhāna, which is wisdom, self existing gnosis, or as one of my friend says, ‘Thought having sex with itself,’ which is actually relating to itself as another being, so that in my intellect even there is evidence that I’m not alone, and when you think that through it means we’ve never actually departed from something that we laugh at or put on a pedestal as animism. We’ve only just found ways of dealing with a fundamental ontological anxiety about what counts as real by ignoring it or covering it over or otherwise violently distorting it, because it involves violence to do that. And this is not just a philosophical project we’re talking about, this is like an agricultural, social project to transcend the hunter gatherer mode. And the story of the last 12,000 years could be summed up very briefly, you know, like, ‘In order to avoid global warming, we created worse global warming,’ that’s the geological time summation of what we did. In order to cope with the anxiety about where our next meal was coming from, which was sitting on top of the ontological anxiety, like, ‘Is that really a bunny rabbit or is it actually a demon? Or maybe its left leg is like a dimensional gate into some other universe?’ and, ‘Oh it’s really hassling me,’ like paranoia as a default condition of thinking, to cover that over never really fully works and results in violence, and results in autoimmune disorders of the intellect which are philosophical paradoxes but also depression actually, and autoimmune disorders of life forms, namely this kind of self destroying, self cancelling thing that we’ve gotten ourselves into. So I’m not sure resistance, I’m not sure about resisting the modern, I’m not sure that like [Theodor W.] Adorno, like, ‘Where have all the latches gone? All these windows are all smooth in Los Angeles,’ that’s fascist, you know, like I’m not sure that latches is make it better, you know? I think in the end noticing that you’re never totally sure about that bunny rabbit is kind of what makes it—wow—that.
[Loud thunder in the background]
  Was that the storm?
  Yes, the reason I’ve gone slightly dark on the video, as you’ll see, is that there’s a fantastic… It’s one of these Houston storms where… For some reason it always comes just above my house.
  It’s incredible that we’re having this conversation about extinction and there is an apocalyptic storm!
  [Laughter] Yes, they always sound like that, like, ‘This is the end,’ you know?
  Now a few last questions about queer ecology. You very often have actually mentioned, in texts and also talks, this idea of bringing together, of an alignment, of queer theory and ecology, and I was wondering — because I’m always very interested when such amazing ideas are born, and with scientists one can very often locate when… Benoît Mandelbrot once told me the day he discovered, on a slightly blurry, not clean blackboard, the first time fractals. So I was wondering if you can tell us about when this path-breaking epiphany came to you: to bring together these two things, queer theory and ecology? How did that happen?
  Well Hans Ulrich, it all happened when… I think it actually did happen in 2007, or maybe 2005ish, the early 2000s when I was beginning to think things through. I think there’s even a reference to it in Ecology Without Nature so it must have happened somewhere in the early 2000s. And it was just a thing that was beginning to occur to me in terms of I don’t really believe in nature, I believe in ecology; I think nature is actually a human construct, I think that’s what’s wrong with it. It’s not like I don’t believe in coral, I do believe in coral which is why I don’t believe in nature. And I think that not only is nature a human philosophical construct, an aesthetic construct, it’s also a social construct that is one of the reasons for this violence, is this concept nature actually. And so I think that ecology must necessarily be without nature. And nature is usually taken to mean things being exactly what they are, right? And so eventually over time I realized the deep ontological reason why I don’t accept nature is because things are always exactly what they aren’t. There’s always this gap between what they are and how they appear, and the gap is such that you can’t locate it anywhere in the entities, on the entity or in the entity, it’s just kind of there like a twist in a Möbius strip, it’s everywhere, it’s ortt. It’s a twist, it’s what ortt means, you know, some kind of fairy magic twist to everything. And I think that since there’s no nature there’s no such thing as natural, and so that means that the way I think about ecology has this affinity with queer theory, and I think that maybe a little bit unlike most strands of queer theory I actually am an essentialist, that’s the thing, I’m a big bad naughty essentialist, but I’m saying the way things are is intrinsically queer. In other words there are baseballs, but they’re not solidly baseball-ish all the way through. It’s like a frog doesn’t contain a little image of itself all the way through itself, or a little sign that says, ‘This is a frog, do not panic, this is just a part of a frog,’ all the way down like one of those sticks of Brighton rock, you suck it and there’s the word all the way down the stick there. So I think the way things are is necessarily twisted, like all objects, in order to be objects, are actually deviant, there is no one straight unperverse object, I think everything is kind of deviant that way, and so I think that there’s a natural fit. And it started occurring to me as I was thinking this through, but now I think it’s much more… Like, I have a really good reason for it, which is that cushions and telephones and staircases and lightening is all so twisted, there’s no straight. And so eventually I started being asked to write stuff directly on queer ecology and I’m very happy about that, and I’m very happy that you’re including it in the Extinction Marathon, because obviously the drive to reproduce sexually, that’s maybe part of the problem, isn’t it? Because it’s not just a human problem about population. I’m going to touch the third rail and say the word population; now everybody, you can think I’m a Nazi, but it’s also a wheat problem. It’s like, ‘Let’s get rid of the flowers, let’s have these big fat juicy wheat stalks, and then we can eat them better,’ and all that. Social space has all been about, since the agricultural age started, making things that have less and less and less sexy appearance, and sexual selection, it’s so expensive from DNA’s point of view — it’s actually not utilitarian at all, which means that genes aren’t really just selfish—sorry Richard Dawkins—it means that there is some kind of disturbingly meaningless aesthetic component to how genomics, how genetics, actually works, and that’s because there’s a kind of weird, disturbing, sexy causality, which is also aesthetic, about how anything works, and that we’ve been trying to edit that out for a long time. And that what art is actually doing of course is directly messing with cause and effect, which is why it’s disturbing to most philosophers, isn’t it? Like, ‘Oh no, I’m being taken over by this demonic force from the beyond and it’s doing something to me, and I shouldn’t have emotion.’ And so there’s a kind of intuitive way in which we all know that art is causality because causality is aesthetic. So this a long winded answer to your question, but yes, there’s an intrinsic link between ecology and queer theory but it’s not that everything is constructed, especially in particular by humans, it’s that there’s this irreducible gap between being and appearing that you can’t locate anywhere on the surface or depths of a thing, and so to exist is to be twisted.


  That could almost be a conclusion. I have a few last questions: I wanted to ask you, in relation to our Marathon, to what extent you think that queer ecology can help us understand extinction anew — and what would be the political stakes of this?
  Well like I say, the drive to retweet the agriculture meme, to constantly be reproducing it over and over and over again, which involves sexual reproduction, which isn’t a bad thing, is intrinsic to the ecological disaster that we’re in, and so we need desperately to be able to think how something like queer theory and queer politics and queerness in general fits into our world and isn’t just a kind of human flavoured, superficial thing, but is… Not just even an evolution thing in the kind of Joan Roughgarden sense, that heterosexuality is just a very, very thin layer sitting on top of a giant ocean of all kinds of other sexuality, but that actually we are living in a multi sexual object universe where there is no one way in which… There is no dominant top object, one of these things is not like the other, you can’t have that, which is why you cannot have a meta language that explains everything, which is also why you cannot have one one-size-fits-all political system. And so yes, I think so, I think queer theory forces you to start thinking about preserving entities that are ephemeral and fragile and intrinsically finite, which is what we all are, you know, and none of us are completely plastically transparent to ourselves, and none of us are totally ourselves completely all the way down. And thinking that involves a kind of exposure, and it involves involves a kind of ecological act actually of preserving that weirdness as much as you can, and that’s kind of where the Extinction Marathon meets the queer theory I think, it has to do with not just preserving but fostering the multiplicity of peculiarness that constitutes reality as such, and not allowing it to die into one bland lump of [[makes a sound to indicate something negative]], that’s not going to happen, we don’t want that to happen.


  And maybe one very last question: re-reading Deleuze and then reading your comments on Deleuze’s Rhizome, as a metaphor at the crosspoint of all kinds of fluid sexualities — I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that?
  Oh sure. You know, the funny thing is that in reviews of my stuff, you know, readers’ reports before it gets published and all that, people usually say, ‘I had no idea he was this Deleuzian,’ and I’m like, ‘I didn’t realize it was that obvious, obviously I didn’t make enough of an effort to hide it.’ Maybe I just talk in a different language to Deleuze; Deleuze talks in his way about rhizomes and plateaus and all that, and I talk about saucepans and bunnies and stuff. Maybe there’s not that much of a difference fundamentally, and maybe… You know, like my friend Jane Bennett, the author of Vibrant Matter, we had this awesome conversation last year where we both decided that what we do, we make toys—this is where this toy stuff is coming from—we make toys for people to play with, and I think that’s Deleuze’s mission and Jane is a Deleuzian, and I’m all in favour of making toys. I think that the reality principle is overrated; actually I think it doesn’t really exist, does it? And so imposing it or getting used to it or accommodating myself to it is not that great because it’s ontologically violent as well as politically funny. So in a way that kind of energy’s coming out of the situationism, punk idea, you know, ‘I take my dreams for reality because I believe in the reality of my… I take my desires for reality because I believe in the reality of my desires.’ And so yes, I feel like I don’t want to use this space as a way to go, ‘And in this little tiny bit of how I think I’m quite different from Deleuze because he blah blah blah.’ You know, we do have our differences; I think fundamentally it’s not me and Deleuze though, it’s me and Deleuzian materialists who might not be that Deleuzian in the end, people who think that there’s this kind of Spinozan substance or something quite Whiteheadian process. To me that’s not totally Deleuze. Like take Deleuze’s concept of the smooth, which I really like, and Claire Colebrook has enlightened me on this: the smooth means that things are so granular, like you’re up against the surface of the painting or whatever and you’re so close to something that you can’t grip it with your conceptual mind; it doesn’t mean that everything is completely opaque. There are some Deleuze conferences apparently where people only wear felt because wool is striated and that’s bad, and felt is nomadic and, ‘That’s what we want,’ and that’s just whack, isn’t it? And that’s the fashion equivalent of a kind of materialism that’s holding onto some idea of, ‘There must be some bedrock underneath reality that’s more real than this one,’ which is just ontotheological metaphysics really.


  This is amazing, thank you so, so much. I’ve got one very last question, which is out of all my 2,400 hours of interviews so far, it’s my only ever recurring question. It comes always from my early encounter with the late Italian artist Alighiero Boetti who said that as a curator I should not just look out at what practices do and then bring that into exhibitions, but I should actually listen to the practitioners, to artists, philosophers, scientists — what they would like to do but cannot do within the existing parameters of society. And particularly the artists, we know about artists’ unrealized projects; we know a lot about architects’ unrealized projects, they publish and publicize them, very often get things built by publishing unbuilt work. But if you think about film directors, artists, visual artists, scientists, philosophers, poets, we know very, very little about their unrealized projects — hence I always conclude all my interviews with the question of what are your unrealized projects? What are projects which have been too big to be realized, too small to be realized? Maybe also utopic projects which are unrealizable or partially unrealizable in terms of transformation of society, or — as Doris Lessing in our last conversation before her death… we had this conversation, she was very old, in her nineties, and Doris said, ‘This question is actually not complete unless we ask about the projects, the books we didn’t dare to write, because there are the books which are censored, but then there are the books we don’t have time to write.’ So I was wondering: what are the unbuilt roads for you, the unrealized projects?


  OK, wow. Well first of all I’d like to say what a wonderful thing to ask anybody, it’s so generous and it’s so open, and since I think that art and thinking are ways of tuning rather than imposing your concept or getting something to fit, it’s like listening, like attunement, something’s already there and your task is to kind of tune to it, slightly merge, tuning. Since I think that, I think your question is really profound, and it’s not just about, ‘So what are you up to?’ you know. So I feel like I’ve only just started putting these thoughts together; I never feel like I put the thoughts together exactly right, so I’ve got a number of projects where I’m putting the thoughts together slightly different. And I have this book Dark Ecology which is based on these lectures I did in Irvine, the Wellek Lectures, and that’s kind of what we were just talking about actually. But then there’s this slightly more future project, I don’t know what it’s called anymore; it used to be called Weird Essentialism but I don’t think it’s called that anymore. And I’m trying to go again into ontology for real, like, ‘What is the nature of reality, and is there a politics there?’ Actually I think there is. And I’m working with a lot of artists, and that’s my favourite, favourite thing to do with my whole life because they want me to help them to put words to what they’re already doing, and there’s something about that that… First of all I’m in a very good spot because it means I’m not imposing my concept, and it means I’m listening, and it’s very meaningful to me and I don’t think that has an end. And I think what I do started off in intellectual mode, and it still will be, but intellectual world can be a little bit of a kind of competition zoo space where… The very low stakes war, you know, like people are competing for one inch of ground, and art is obviously much more open than that intrinsically; I’m not saying there are not people who suck in any walk of life, I’m just saying that I’m very lucky because I think what I do in my job is a little bit cheeky anyway and I tend to piss off a lot of people in my fields that I work in in the academy, and often people are like, ‘Oh, this isn’t a book, this isn’t an essay,’ you know, strangled at birth, but artists are kind enough and they understand a little bit what I’m saying and it kind of clicks, and so I feel like I’m collaborating. And on that note I had this idea, and this isn’t copyright Tim so someone else can do it — we should all do it, right? I want to form an organization called the IPCC, have you ever heard of it? This one is the Interplanetary Caring Citizens, IPCC; it’s the intergovernmental panel on climate change but my one is going to be the Intraplanetary Caring Citizens group or groups. And the idea of these groups is it’s going to be artists and philosophers and politics people and anyone with any kind of creative anything, and we’re going to do news conferences about ecology and global warming. Because clearly the science isn’t getting to people because the scientists are duty bound to tell the truth which is, ‘Yes, it’s statistically very, very, very likely,’ and that means true. And really true, not just in a religious dogma assertion true, it’s like post Hume, post Kant modernity true, ‘We see these correlations in the data and they seem to be causal.’ Nevertheless that gives everyone an out, they don’t have to believe it because it’s possible but it’s not… ‘Because believing means clutching onto things really tightly,’ and all that, right? And so I think that we should all do these news conferences where we just amaze people, and I think we should not be in the persuasion business anymore, please, please, about ecological reality, we should be in the amazing people business. We should do some kind of magic, we should be making some kind of miracle where people are so compelled by this miracle that before they realize they’ve changed their belief, they’ve already changed. So that’s what I want to do, IPCC, let’s make a lot of them.
                
                
Designing our Complex Future with Machines
                                                                                
While I had long been planning to write a manifesto against the technological singularity and launch it into the conversational sphere for public reaction and comment, an invitation earlier this year from John Brockman to read and discuss The Human Use of Human Beings by Norbert Wiener with him and his illustrious group of thinkers as part of an ongoing collaborative book project contributed to the thoughts contained herein.
                
Nature’s ecosystem provides us with an elegant example of a complex adaptive system where myriad “currencies” interact and respond to feedback systems that enable both flourishing and regulation. This collaborative model–rather than a model of exponential financial growth or the Singularity, which promises the transcendence of our current human condition through advances in technology— should provide the paradigm for our approach to artificial intelligence. More than 60 years ago, MIT mathematician and philosopher Norbert Wiener warned us that “when human atoms are knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible human beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is flesh and blood.” We should heed Wiener’s warning.


                                        
As the sun beats down on Earth, photosynthesis converts water, carbon dioxide and the sun’s energy into oxygen and glucose. Photosynthesis is one of the many chemical and biological processes that transforms one form of matter and energy into another. These molecules then get metabolized by other biological and chemical processes into yet other molecules. Scientists often call these molecules “currencies” because they represent a form of power that is transferred between cells or processes to mutual benefit—“traded,” in effect. The biggest difference between these and financial currencies is that there is no “master currency” or “currency exchange.” Rather, each currency can only be used by certain processes, and the “market” of these currencies drives the dynamics that are “life.”
                                        
As certain currencies became abundant as an output of a successful process or organism, other organisms evolved to take that output and convert it into something else. Over billions of years, this is how the Earth’s ecosystem has evolved, creating vast systems of metabolic pathways and forming highly complex self- regulating systems that, for example, stabilize our body temperatures or the temperature of the Earth, despite continuous fluctuations and changes among the individual elements at every scale—from micro to macro. The output of one process becomes the input of another. Ultimately, everything interconnects.
                                        
We live in a civilization in which the primary currencies are money and power— where more often than not, the goal is to accumulate both at the expense of society at large. This is a very simple and fragile system compared to the Earth’s ecosystems, where myriads of “currencies” are exchanged among processes to create hugely complex systems of inputs and outputs with feedback systems that adapt and regulate stocks, flows, and connections.
                                        
Unfortunately, our current human civilization does not have the built-in resilience of our environment, and the paradigms that set our goals and drive the evolution of society today have set us on a dangerous course which the mathematician Norbert Wiener warned us about decades ago. The paradigm of a single master currency has driven many corporations and institutions to lose sight of their original missions. Values and complexity are focused more and more on prioritizing exponential financial growth, led by for-profit corporate entities that have gained autonomy, rights, power, and nearly unregulated societal influence. The behavior of these entities are akin to cancers. Healthy cells regulate their growth and respond to their surroundings, even eliminating themselves if they wander into an organ where they don’t belong. Cancerous cells, on the other hand, optimize for unconstrained growth and spread with disregard to their function or context.
                                        
The idea that we exist for the sake of progress, and that progress requires unconstrained and exponential growth, is the whip that lashes us.
                        
Modern companies are the natural product of this paradigm in a free-market capitalist system. Norbert Wiener called corporations “machines of flesh and blood” and automation “machines of metal.” The new species of Silicon Valley mega companies—the machines of bits—are developed and run in great part by people who believe in a new religion, Singularity. This new religion is not a fundamental change in the paradigm, but rather the natural evolution of the worship of exponential growth applied to modern computation and science.                                         
An asymptote is a line that continually approaches a given curve but does not meet it at any finite distance. In singularity, this is the vertical line that occurs when the exponential growth curve a vertical line. There are more arguments about where this asymptote is among believers than about whether it is actually coming of the exponential growth of computational power is artificial intelligence.
                                        
The notion of Singularity—that AI will supercede humans with its exponential growth, and that everything we have done until now and are currently doing is insignificant—is a religion created by people who have the experience of using computation to solve problems heretofore considered impossibly complex for machines. They have found a perfect partner in digital computation—a seemingly knowable, controllable, system of thinking and creating that is rapidly increasing in its ability to harness and process complexity, bestowing wealth and power on those who have mastered it. In Silicon Valley, the combination of groupthink and the financial success of this cult of technology has created a positive feedback system that has very little capacity for regulating through negative feedback. While they would resist having their beliefs compared to a religion and would argue that their ideas are science- and evidence-based, those who embrace Singularity engage in quite a bit of arm waving and make leaps of faith based more on trajectories than ground-truths to achieve their ultimate vision.
                                        
Singularitarians believe that the world is “knowable” and computationally simulatable, and that computers will be able to process the messiness of the real world just like they have every other problem that everyone said couldn’t be solved by computers. To them, this wonderful tool, the computer, has worked so well for everything so far that it must continue to work for every challenge we throw at it, until we have transcended known limitations and ultimately achieve some sort of reality escape velocity. Artificial intelligence is already displacing humans in driving cars, diagnosing cancers, and researching court documents. The idea is that AI will continue this progress and eventually merge with human brains and become an all-seeing, all-powerful, super-intelligence. For true believers, computers will augment and extend our thoughts into a kind of “amortality.” (Part of Singularity is a fight for “amortality,” the idea that while one may still die and not be immortal, the death is not the result of the grim reaper of aging.)


                                
But if corporations are a precursor to our transcendance, the Singularitarian view that with more computing and bio-hacking we will somehow solve all of the world’s problems or that the Singularity will solve us seems hopelessly naive. As we dream of the day when we have enhanced brains and amortality and can think big, long thoughts, corporations already have a kind of “amortality.” They persist as long as they are solvent and they are more than a sum of their parts— arguably an amortal super-intelligence.
                                        
More computation does not makes us more “intelligent,” only more computationally powerful.
                                        
For Singularity to have a positive outcome requires a belief that, given enough power, the system will somehow figure out how to regulate itself. The final outcome would be so complex that while we humans couldn’t understand it now,
                                        
“it” would understand and “solve” itself. Some believe in something that looks a bit like the former Soviet Union’s master planning but with full information and unlimited power. Others have a more sophisticated view of a distributed system, but at some level, all Singularitarians believe that with enough power and control, the world is “tamable.” Not all who believe in Singularity worship it as a positive transcendence bringing immortality and abundance, but they do believe that a judgment day is coming when all curves go vertical.
                                        
Whether you are on an S-curve or a bell curve, the beginning of the slope looks a lot like an exponential curve. An exponential curve to systems dynamics people shows self-reinforcement, i.e., a positive feedback curve without limits. Maybe this is what excites Singularitarians and scares systems people. Most people outside the Singularity bubble believe in S-curves: nature adapts and self-regulates, and, for example, when a pandemic has run its course, growth slows and things adapt. They may not be in the same state, and a phase change could occur, but the notion of Singularity—especially as some sort of savior or judgment day that will allow us to transcend the messy, mortal suffering of our human existence—is fundamentally a flawed one.
                                        
This sort of reductionist thinking isn’t new. Learning scientists know now that behaviorist approaches only work for a narrow range of learning, but many schools continue to rely on drill and practice. Take, as another example, the eugenics movement, which greatly and incorrectly over-simplified the role of genetics in society. The echoes of the horrors of eugenics exist today, making almost any research trying to link genetics with things like intelligence taboo.
                                        
We should learn from our history of applying over-reductionist science to society and try to, as Wiener says, “cease to kiss the whip that lashes us.” While it is one of the key drivers of science—to elegantly explain the complex and reduce confusion to understanding—we must also remember what Albert Einstein said,
“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”                                        
This is a common paraphrase. What Einstein actually said was, “It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.”
                                        
We need to embrace the unknowability—the irreducibility—of the real world that artists, biologists and those who work in the messy world of liberal arts and humanities are familiar with.
                                        
The Cold War era, when Wiener was writing The Human Use of Human Beings, was a time defined by the rapid expansion of capitalism and consumerism, the beginning of the space race, and the coming of age of computation. It was a time when it was easier to believe that systems could be controlled from the outside, and that many of the world’s problems would be solved through science and engineering.
                                        
The cybernetics that Wiener primarily described during that period were concerned with feedback systems that can be controlled or regulated from an objective perspective. This so-called first-order cybernetics assumed that the scientist as the observer can understand what is going on, therefore enabling the engineer to design systems based on observation or insight from the scientist.
                                        
Today, it is much more obvious that most of our problems—climate change, poverty, obesity and chronic disease, or modern terrorism—cannot be solved simply with more resources and greater control. That is because they are the result of complex adaptive systems that are often the result of the tools used to solve problems in the past, such as endlessly increasing productivity and attempts to control things. This is where second-order cybernetics comes into play—the cybernetics of self-adaptive complex systems, where the observer is also part of the system itself. As Kevin Slavin says in Design as Participation,
                                        
“You’re Not Stuck In Traffic—You Are Traffic.”
                                        
Western philosophy and science is “dualistic” as opposed to the more “Eastern” non-dualistic approach. A whole essay could be written about this but the idea of a subject/object or a designer/designee is partially linked to the notion of self in Western philosophy and religion.
                                        
In order to effectively respond to the significant scientific challenges of our times, I believe we must view the world as many interconnected, complex, self-adaptive systems across scales and dimensions that are unknowable and largely inseparable from the observer and the designer. In other words, we are participants in multiple evolutionary systems with different fitness landscapes
                                        
Fitness landscapes arise when you assign a fitness value for every genotype. The genotypes are arranged in a high dimensional sequence space. The fitness landscape is a function on that sequence space. In evolutionary dynamics, a biological population moves over a fitness landscape driven by mutation, selection and random drift. (Nowak, M. A. Evolutionary Dynamics: Exploring the Equations of Life. Harvard University Press, 2006.)
                                        
at different scales, from our microbes to our individual identities to society and our species. Individuals themselves are systems composed of systems of systems, such as the cells in our bodies that behave more like system-level designers than we do.
                                        
While Wiener does discuss biological evolution and the evolution of language, he doesn’t explore the idea of harnessing evolutionary dynamics for science. Biological evolution of individual species (genetic evolution) has been driven by reproduction and survival, instilling in us goals and yearnings to procreate and grow. That system continually evolves to regulate growth, increase diversity and complexity, and enhance its own resilience, adaptability, and sustainability.
                                        
As designers with growing awareness of these broader systems, we have goals and methodologies defined by the evolutionary and environmental inputs from our biological and societal contexts. But machines with emergent intelligence have discernibly different goals and methodologies. As we introduce machines into the system, they will not only augment individual humans, but they will also—and more importantly—augment complex systems as a whole.
                                        
Here is where the problematic formulation of “artificial intelligence” becomes evident, as it suggests forms, goals and methods that stand outside of interaction with other complex adaptive systems. Instead of thinking about machine intelligence in terms of humans vs. machines, we should consider the system that integrates humans and machines—not artificial intelligence, but extended intelligence. Instead of trying to control or design or even understand systems, it is more important to design systems that participate as responsible, aware and robust elements of even more complex systems. And we must question and adapt our own purpose and sensibilities as designers and components of the system for a much more humble approach: Humility over Control.
                                        
We could call it “participant design”—design of systems as and by participants— that is more akin to the increase of a flourishing function, where flourishing is a measure of vigor and health rather than scale or power. We can measure the ability for systems to adapt creatively, as well as their resilience and their ability to use resources in an interesting way.
        
Better interventions are less about solving or optimizing and more about developing a sensibility appropriate to the environment and the time. In this way they are more like music than an algorithm. Music is about a sensibility or “taste” with many elements coming together into a kind of emergent order. Instrumentation can nudge or cause the system to adapt or move in an unpredictable and unprogrammed manner, while still making sense and holding together. Using music itself as an intervention is not a new idea; in 1707, Andrew Fletcher, a Scottish writer and politician, said, “Let me make the songs of a nation, I care not who makes its laws.”
                                        
If writing songs instead of laws feels frivolous, remember that songs typically last longer than laws, have played key roles in various hard and soft revolutions and end up being transmitted person-to-person along with the values they carry. It’s not about music or code. It’s about trying to affect change by operating at the level songs do. This is articulated by Donella Meadows, among others, in her book Thinking in Systems.
                                        
Meadows, in her essay Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System, describes how we can intervene in a complex, self-adaptive system. For her, interventions that involve changing parameters or even changing the rules are not nearly as powerful or as fundamental as changes in a system’s goals and paradigms.
                                                                                
Those who uphold the idea of progress as an ethical principle regard this unlimited and quasi-spontaneous process of change as a Good Thing, and as the basis on which they guarantee to future generations a Heaven on Earth. It is possible to believe in progress as a fact without believing in progress as an ethical principle; but in the catechism of many Americans, the one goes with the other.
                                                                                
Instead of discussing “sustainability” as something to be “solved” in the context of a world where bigger is still better and more than enough is NOT too much, perhaps we should examine the values and the currencies of the fitness functions.
                                        
A fitness function is a function that is used to summarise, as a measure of merit, how close a solution is to a particular aim. It is used to describe and design evolutionary systems and consider whether they are suitable and appropriate for the systems in which we participate.
                        
Developing a sensibility and a culture of flourishing. This article is usually taken as the start of modern virtue ethics that has revived Aristotelian ethics in the face of the problems faced by the more traditional ethics that either tries to establish moral principles or relies on a utilitarian calculus of benefits and harms. Virtue ethics instead asks what makes a good life: how we can blossom, grow, flourish?
— and embracing a diverse array of measures of “success” depend less on the accumulation of power and resources and more on diversity and the richness of experience. This is the paradigm shift that we need. This will provide us with a wealth of technological and cultural patterns to draw from to create a highly adaptable society. This diversity also allows the elements of the system to feed each other without the exploitation and extraction ethos created by a monoculture with a single currency. It is likely that this new culture will spread as music, fashion, spirituality or other forms of art.


I am heartened by a group of junior high school students I spoke to there recently who, when I challenged them about what they thought we should do about the environment, asked questions about the meaning of happiness and the role of humans in nature. I am likewise heartened to see many of my students at the MIT Media Lab and in the Principles of Awareness class that I co-teach with the Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi using a variety of metrics (currencies) to measure their success and meaning and grappling directly with the complexity of finding one’s place in our complex world.
                                        
In the 1960s and 70s, the hippie movement tried to pull together a “whole earth” movement, but then the world swung back toward the consumer and consumption culture of today. I hope and believe that a new awakening will happen and that a new sensibility will cause a nonlinear change in our behavior through a cultural transformation. While we can and should continue to work at every layer of the system to create a more resilient world, I believe the cultural layer is the layer with the most potential for a fundamental correction away from the self-destructive path that we are currently on. I think that it will yet again be about the music and the arts of the young people reflecting and amplifying a new sensibility: a turn away from greed to a world where “more than enough is too much,” and we can flourish in harmony with Nature rather than through the control of it.


Speculative Design (SD) understands itself as progressive alternative perspective to mainstream Design culture (and as an alternative to other alternatives as well). It knows that “Design” is not some magic way of thinking (involving stick-up notes, sharpies and colored beanbags) that just makes things better by “building trust,” “understanding the customer” or “getting a seat at the table” or similar. Design is also the means by which pathological relationships to material culture are made more efficient and more delightful, and we are worse for it. Some may even conclude that the job of Design in the 21st century is to undo (much of) the Design of 20th. It may also be to re-claim and re-launch other frustrated Modern impulses that were dry-docked by century’s end, not only designing things —widgets, withdrawn objects, manifest subjectivities, formal forms, etc.— but also designing the relations between them: systems, supply-chains, encounters, obligations, accounting protocols, and so on.
As an alternative perspective, speculation is not ephemeral or disengaged. The prevalence of models for risk patterns, ideal options, and plotted-outcomes underscores that speculation itself is not a supplemental or marginal process. It is less “airy-fairy” than it is nuts and bolts: whether for commodities and equities futures, automated A/B testing, enterprise reinsurance or weather forecasting, the global economy functions by speculative models of the near or long-term future.2 But if so does this disqualify the speculative from the figuring of fundamental alternatives? It does not. Instead of concluding that the future (and futurism per se) is lost it we should commandeer modeling infrastructures for better and more vibrant purposes. For this, speculative models are rotated from one purpose to another: less to predict what is most likely to happen (deriving value from advance simulation of given outcomes) than to search the space of actual possibility (even and especially beyond what any of us would conceive otherwise.)3 That is, predictive models are adaptive because they need to be descriptive, but for speculation, models are prescriptive because they need to become normative. Between them we track different uses for contingency, imminence, simulation, navigation, resistance, governmentality, universality, neutrality, etc.4 That is where Design becomes designation.5
Futurism, Scale        
For obvious reasons it is commonly presumed that there must be an overlap between SD and the more general pursuit of Design Futures, or prototypes from the worlds of tomorrow. Sometimes there are clear alignments, especially for SD projects that address “the future” explicitly as critical subject matter. As I put it elsewhere, in our culture speaking about “the future” is a way of saying things about the present—critical, utopian, projective, pragmatic and/or simply unspeakable things—but too often it is an alibi for saying nothing at all.6 “The future” is that place where skateboards hover and ambient fields of graphical user-interfaces are slightly more elysian; it is a rhetorical sink where half-baked marketing plans usurp the place where actual ideas are supposed to go.
Given this, we may expect a more intellectually and politically rigorous SD to resist—or even eliminate—futurity as a key concept or site condition. Some might insist that it focus instead on the most immediate at-hand frames of spatial and temporal reference, and to deal with coming conditions largely through the hard or soft survivalist aesthetics that ensue. “There is no time, and there is only this place” may be the rationale for this emergency interventionism. Others lament that facts on the ground are out-of-sync with fragmented social history. They hint that until recent times sociological “cognitive maps,” on the one hand, and systemic historical unfolding, on the other, may have been in conflict but at least their common ground felt solid. For this perspective, the answer to the malaise of network culture is to re-glue the scale and tempo of global forces back to the dialectic parameters of social and psychological history.
I argue that these are both insufficient responses, and that a detected derangement of familiar spatial and temporal scales is not only not pathological, but may be a precondition for any properly calibrated Design imaginary. Design, as we know, can adhere to small, medium, large or extra-large spatial scales (a single object, a large architecture, an urbanism or a transcontinental system). It can also be trained on very short- or very long-term durations (now, later, much later, afterwards) suited to instantaneous user response, the next launch cycle, the lifecycle of a city, or a geologic trace). We may presume that large scales and long durations are natural matches, but there is no reason to hold fast to this. Very small-scale spatial projects with very long duration ramifications are as likely as very large-scale spatial projects with instantaneous durations, and so we can imagine a combinatory matrix of spatial and temporal scales for design analysis and intervention. It is not here and now versus there and then.
In such a matrix, each temporal scale has its own version of “the future” and some are more interesting to SD than others. There is a social future, with an attendant duration measured in fashion cycles or communal memory of place; a technical future, with its cycles of product SKU turnover and mechanic evolution; a historical future, with trans-generational undulations of friend and enemy, capture and memorialization; and a geologic future, with ripples and rhythms that span far longer than the genomic coherency of any apex species.7 Any affective sense of order by which each of these futural forms may be felt to be in special harmony (geologic future in sync with social future, historical future in sync with technological future, etc.) is surely not an organic state but a broken sophistic illusion. In other words, it takes a special kind of anthropocentric naiveté to fully entertain the idea that making all design “human scale” would be a long-term solution to anything but the most pedestrian problems.8 The futures that are probably most worth designing are those that exceed human phenomenology’s intuitive scales of anatomically-embedded spatial navigation and the temporalities of organism life span. It is important to mobilize SD on behalf of conditions that are not-yet-existing here and now, and for that we must further shed local social history’s mooring privilege. That shift does not take leave of the concrete materiality of Design, quite the contrary. It is only possible by returning our attention to one point of origin for Design: the actual matter of contemporary materialism.
Matter, Materialism        
The contemporary project of Design (inclusive of SD) is situated by new materials and material forms. The emergence of “modern” Design is concurrent with the emergence of the materials, processes and technologies of mass production and distribution: plastics, metals, molding, modeling, printing, stamping, shipping, replicating, stacking, etc. For the Design of what Reyner Banham called “the first machine age,” industrial materials allowed for the inexpensive distribution of standardized designs to a mass society: new matter provided for a new materialism. Chemistry as much as economics (probably not so divisible at the end of the day) would drive the anthropology of this era’s tangible culture. The periodic table of the elements, innovated by Mendeleev and others, would provide an alphabet for the composition of substance and conjugation of form. In turn, as techniques became schools of thought and designed forms became fixed at certain levels of implementation (type and image, shelter, apparatus, transportation, etc.), modern Design (and Design education) would coalesce around corresponding expertise in graphic design, industrial design, interaction design, architectural design and so on.9
Today we confront another gamut of materials that is potentially just as transformative. From biotechnology to the internet of things to artificial intelligence and robotics to networked additive manufacturing and replication, this material palette provides for the recomposition of the world at scales previously unthinkable, turning living tissue into a plastic medium and imbuing inorganic machines and landscapes with new sorts of practical intelligence. The social and ecological project for SD is not only to master an articulation of these new registers of matter, but also conceive a (real) new Materialism that would ratify the organization of society in the image of their still largely-unmapped potentials.
For Design practice, these material systems are of interest to the extent that they allow for the remaking of that world at a more granular level, and for Design theory to the extent that they disenchant and demystify something about our world and our species within that world. As each of these also now occupies some spot on the curve of various hype cycles, from wondertech to everyday appliance, the incantation of their names supposedly signifies futuristic thinking — even when it actually does not. The flowering of their potential for Promethean demystification and refashioning is not automatic; it must be designated. Still, it should go without saying that technological populism and biochemical futurism are not essentially anti-progressive (and for future Wes Andersons, these emerging technologies will also provide for/thematize a pastoral gizmo authentique yet-to-come).        
The longer-term development of SD and related initiatives (not just at UC San Diego where I teach, but anywhere) should formulate its professional, theoretical and pedagogic expertise with this contemporary material palette by putting it in contact with other critical experiments and active geopolitical and geoeconomic contexts. At the same time, the translation of new materials into a new program for social and ecological organization may also direct the sometimes overly self-referential Arts and Humanities toward new outward-facing feats of abstraction, imagination and rationalization.
Toward that we should not presume that the initial applications of any of these technologies are those that will define its ultimate range of functions, and indeed, as discussed below, it is the work of SD to probe the contours of that range:
—HAII (Human Artificial Intelligence Interaction design) may illuminate unexpected forms of empathy, intelligence and identity, and not just in the image of human vanity. How will we midwife robotics and synthetic embodiment as they speciate in parallel to and incorporated with existing animal bodies?
—Ubiquitous computation links algorithmic calculation from molecular to landscape scale and seeds communication to and from objects at, below or above a normal human scale of encounter. Urban and continental computational assemblages may flow into our lines of sight, sound and touch or we may be unable to perceive them without sensory augmentation. How do these maps become territories and vice versa?
—Synthetic biology, especially its DIY variants, suggests plots for organic building-blocks re-cast as general purpose programing tools, thus giving biotechnology its overdue garageband phase. Will biology become more computational before computation becomes more biological?


—Epidermal sensors and nanobioelectronics combine and weave natural sensation and machine sensing so thoroughly that we can’t tell which is which, and hinting at skin-based media and designable sensations: toward a molecular gastro-tactility.11 What sort of interface between inside and outside may we wish our skin to provide? What would we do with membranes that communicate, that know, that disclose us to the world in other ways?
—Machine vision is to artificial intelligence what cilia are to protozoa: a sensing and mapping apparatus for incipient machinic abstraction. As I’ve asked, is the real uncanny valley one in which we see ourselves through the eyes of an AI “other” that we may have programmed, but which does not share our aesthetics or motivated interpretations?12
—More at-hand (literally): with more humans having access to a cell phone than to toilets, how for the foreseeable future will the human hand evolve in relation to the modular affordances of that smart slab/ remote control/ homing device/ camera obscura/ cloud tether?
—High-resolution scanning and sensing allows us to perceive properties of physical matter at a scale and precision otherwise inconceivable, making some kinds of metaphysical arguments about objects and ontology instantly moot. How would a textile culture predicated on telescoping and microscoping physical aesthetics affect all of the above —from epidermal media, to synthetic biology, to robotics to what we used to call merely “industrial design”?
—Additive manufacturing, digital fabrication, 4D printing, etc. are then only the most apparent ways in which algorithms re-inaugurate the composability of matter for Design. As it scales to truly global networked fabrication, Design may engage a wholesale remapping of supply-chains, and with them the planetary-scale social relations of material culture more generally.
These make possible (and demand) reformulations of the media and institutions (and spatial and temporal conventions) of those very relations. The quality and scope of political sovereignty is put into play, newly drawn jurisdictional borders are activated, and the polyphony of gender and/or sexual biotechnologies give wider range to the “expression of emotion in man(sic) and animals.” The sluggish churn of autochthonous traditions may be forced to increase pace; modular platforms of everyday urbanism might more extensible (at least as rational as those of the International Space Station). We index the geologic cannibalism of life-as-we-know-it, from plankton blooms to peak oil, and leverage it toward post-Natural food infrastructures. Finally —hopefully— the cognitive crises of globalization(s) (fundamentalisms, nativisms, financial idealisms, etc.) may be folded back on themselves such that something more worthy of the name “civilization” might emerge. And so on.
All that is (deep breath… exhale) not the job of any one program or project or discipline or Design Theory, but together these examples align the contexts in which Design projects project themselves into the foreseeable future. They identify some of the basic media for Art and Design for the next decade, and in order to find out what they are good for, we need hundreds (thousands) of graduates discerning what the new materials can teach us.13
        The problematics that they map are already present now, which should underscore why SD —versus a mode of Design that would optimize the status quo, or forms of Critical Design that talk themselves out of making enforceable normative claims—is the most feasible way out and way forward. Again, the ultimate and most lasting value of the new material palette is not (only) in the things we can make with it, but in how it allows/forces us to re-adjudicate fundamental questions about who we are, what we are, where we are, when we are: how we are.
The Project, The Model        
The work of Design takes shape in the formulation of the project, a unique rhetorical platform, and through the model, which may describe, idealize or activate the claims of a project. What may give SD some special traction is how it constructs the deliberate (and deliberative) ambivalent provisionality between the model and the project. There are more than a few ways it can do this, and I outline some below.
A project is, as the word suggests, a projection of a potential intervention into a situation defined by a certain spatial and temporal range. The project draws on a model of the situation (such as an analytical simulation) and may also result in a model of proposed intervention (such as an architect’s model of the built form). Exactly how a model serves as a descriptive or prescriptive simulation may already determine how the project will frame the spatial or temporal terms of its intervention. That is, the project will argue that its breadth of intervention corresponds in some precise way to the breadth of that in which it intervenes. We may have descriptive models, such as diagrams that summarize complex events and relations into synthetic images, foregrounding the most relevant patterns, we hope. Or instead of those retroactive models, we may instead have realtime simulations of those events and processes that provide an indexical dashboard of their status. Or we may have instrumental diagrams that not only model those events and relations, but which when manipulated by a designer or user, also directly affect them. Graphical user interfaces are an example of this sort of model. Indeed, the history of Design is not only one in which new technologies allow for new forms to be made, but one in which new technologies allow for new kinds of models about what is to be made. These include “Big Data” and similar ways that we automate live models of patterns we could not otherwise deduce.
The modern era of Design innovated models not only for understanding systems but also for understanding the users of those systems. From the ancestral Vitruvian Man to Henry Dreyfuss’s “Joe and Josephine” millions of use-case personas have stood in for larger consumer publics in the specification of designed solutions to standardized psychological requirements. Beyond ergonomic requirements,Cognitive Science-influenced Design would also reconstruct the mental models with which users understand and interact with complex designed systems. One of the chief epistemological and methodological complexities of Design models is how easily one kind of model (descriptive, diagrammatic, diagnostic, normative) can be transposed into the purposes of another (projective, instrumental, managerial, aspirational). This is no less true for data-driven Economic models than it is for concept-driven Speculative models, though the latter may have a more resilient tolerance for the ambiguities that those shifts introduce.14
In relation to such models (and models of models), the agency of the project within SD (and especially within SD education) deserves careful attention, and so the remainder of my remarks will hopefully provide some useful points for further debate.


1. The Prototype and the Prefigurative
Bruce Sterling’s working definition of “Design Fiction” as “the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change” remains a serviceable one for SD, but is also (true to his point) an incomplete assignment. What comes after the suspension, and what homology is there between the prototype and the change? The less certain the link the better the insight, as it may turn out. The impetus to provoke disenchantment with the commonsensical is well-advised. But at the same time, we should be cautious that Design in this vein does not lapse into a merely “prefigurative” material politics, whereby its function becomes to offer up fetishistic ideal forms of some community-to-come, and for which the purification of means pre-occupies and delays the enforcement of its ends.15The relation that different SD practices may have to “the real,” and to enchantment or disenchantment as a strategy, can be quite varied but across that spectrum there is an allegiance to keeping the correspondence between the prototype and the outcome, the cause and effect, an open and winding path—not a straight line. Sometimes you build a kite and it evolves into 4Chan.16
2. Prometheus is Late for an Appointment with the Killer Apes
The material palette/ emerging technologies cited above are “emerging” faster than are our theoretical and conceptual frameworks can orient them and be oriented by them. While such anomie is probably par for all modernities, our problem is not just with things like nanotechnology and global migration flows. It is also with simple things like sugar, and how our hunter-gatherer propensity for glucose, sucrose and fructose and our sentimental neo-Creationist ideas about food, have built the chemical supply-chain of cuisine as a diabetes megastructure. A cup of demystification beats a pound of remediation.
Our current thinking is what makes these technologies possible and is what prevents them from fully reaching their capacities for meaningful innovation.17 Accordingly, maximizing institutional investment in engineering capacity while minimizing investment in the conceptual and critical capacity that would sustain implementation is an irrational policy. Universities take heed: the efficient, illuminated path is to balance means and vision. Sustained and diverse investment in conceptually-courageous, culturally-informed, norm-making Design, Art and Humanities is necessary to realize the social value of investments in emerging technology. That said, it is also true that sometimes romantic and reactionary posturing (and general technical ignorance) in some such discourses and departments (present company excluded of course!) makes a course correction more difficult than it should be.
3. Discovery over Optimization
As said, for Design practice emerging technologies are interesting to the extent that they allow for the remaking of the world at a more granular level, and, especially in a research university, emerging technologies are interesting to Design theory to the extent that they demystify and disclose something about our world and our species (and others) within it. That is, our contemplation and configuration of possible uses not only provides new means to do what we already understand must be done, but also may de-authorize our secular superstitions about who should do what with whom. That can mean different things to different people, and so much the better.
4. Stem Cell as Pharmakon
Any sufficiently powerful/ efficacious technology is simultaneously both good and bad (not or: and). So, pick your metaphor, Greek or germline. Emerging technologies are Pharmakoi: they are remedies and poisons. Any plan for them, or commentary on them, that evangelizes their positive or negative potential without articulating the inverse is incomplete and/or dishonest. Or if you like, emerging technologies are like stem cells; they could become this or they could become that, and which it will be is undecided but still decidable. Again, it is unwise to announce that their early manifestations (good or bad) represent their essential character and potential. We simply don’t know what they are good for yet, and so the search space of possibilities must be kept open for as long as possible (see above on balanced investment in means and conceptualization).
5. Art/ Design Can do Things that Science Can’t and/or is Not Allowed to Do
Even in the same research institution, sometimes the research that an Artist or Designer conducts may be essentially the same as what a Scientist may attempt, but one experiment can happen and the other cannot. The disciplinary permissions are different, and so the arbitrage of leeway is a space for ideation and discovery.18         
Examples from the 1990’s heyday Bio-Art are plentiful, but also consider the 2002 re-staging of Milgram’s Obedience to Authority Experiment by Rod Dickinson in Glasgow’s CCA Gallery, and the likelihood that any Human Test Subjects research review committee would approve any new follow-on studies by the Psychology faculty. Recently, I heard Jacob Applebaum discussing the Autonomy Cube, a collaboration with Trevor Paglen, and its installation in various Art galleries and museums, where this Tor meta-object, anonymizing invisible data packets in our immediate midst, drew the scorn of local security officials. Outside the gallery, the device may have been confiscated or otherwise intercepted, but inside the gallery—where mimesis takes precedence— the sculpture is granted a kind of asylum and immunity from prosecution. Karolina Sobecka builds cloud-making and –tracking machines, collaborating informally and unofficially with climate researchers at Scripps Institute of Oceanography here at U.C. San Diego. There are now both hard and soft moratoria on experimental geoengineering research by scientists, but her projects are possible if conducted as “only” Art. SD is a zone where the tactical exceptions to norms can be granted and where, thereby, new norms are prototyped with some impunity.
6. The Best Worst/ Worst Best Thing You Can Think Of
For students, particularly younger and inexperienced students, the conventions of mainstream Design culture are sometimes an obstacle to the formulation of original research and a provocative project. Unworkable pitches for TechCrunch (“It’s Tinder meets AirBnB for Oculus Rift”) or an idealistic non-profit (“biofuel-powered hackathons for mindfulness”) are the default idioms.
I counsel students that their projects should seek to span two balances. For the first, we are uncertain whether the project is “real” (did it happen, is it really being proposed to happen, are these prototypes functional, are those images composites, etc.?) It may be clear to us, the viewers/respondents/users of the work, that this uncertainty is deliberate and that our interpretation depends on thinking it through. Ideally, if as we examine the work more carefully we are yet even less sure how “real” the work is (even unsure of the designer’s own intentions), then it is possible that instructive fault-lines between common sense and emergent reason can be discerned.19
The second balance to be pursued is not ontological, but ethical and programmatic. If we are taken aback by the strength of the design proposal, and are certain that should this project be realized it would have dramatic, significant effect, but are also uncertain whether doing so would be the best thing or the worst thing in the world (and more unsure the more we consider the project), then it is more likely that there are original and serious insights be gleaned from the research.
Ambiguity, abstraction and ambivalence are signals of successful Design Research, and the best SD projects position us between pro and con interpretations: is this ethical and/or unethical, is this remedy and/or poison? If we already know that such thing would be one or the other, then the project may not suggest an interesting direction for ongoing experimentation. We know the outcome in advance. This is not to say that Design practice as a whole should not solve clear problems in clever ways (we are thankful for usable tools and interfaces that match doxic mental models and for the effects of scale that they provide), but the SD research program has a specific interest and allegiance to ambiguity not just as a means but as an end in and of itself.
7. 10,000 Year Site Conditions
Among my favorite well-known SD briefs was one written by the United States Department of Energy’s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management’s Yucca Mountain Project (YMP). Proposals were solicited for a signage system that would warn-off curious future excavations from accidentally unearthing radioactive nuclear waste to be buried there in the desert. “Engineers, archaeologists, anthropologists, and linguists [were convened] to design effective warning structures capable of lasting 10,000 years … Using archeological sites as ‘historical analogues.’”20
The brief is interesting for how it simultaneously demands both open speculation as to who/what would be reading the proposed semiotics and for how strongly the answers must be tethered to the very real dangers. The temporal scale of the proposed intervention (over 130 average human generations) is what demands super-speculative hyper-utilitarianism. It invites proposals that are genuinely uncanny because they are absolutely functional.
I believe that we would be better served by similar briefs for other design problems. If we were to use 10,000 years to situate the successful design of other important domains (multigenerational housing, sovereign geographies, gender hacks, human-artificial intelligence interaction, transnational urbanism, egalitarian synthetic biology, or interspecies communication, etc.), I am confident that the design solutions (for us to grow into over time) would be both more imaginative and more functional than those prepared for yearly, decadal or average human organism lifespan durations.
Furthermore, considering our interest in developing pedagogies that impart a more accurate understanding of where and when we actually are—based, one hopes, on geological time and astrophysical place—then a pedagogy of “long circuits” would not just be one in which the speed of information technology is slowed to the pace of phenomenal contemplation (per Bernard Stiegler) but rather one in which technical contemplation-composition is extended to the actual duration of its chemical and ecological reverberations.


Today we visited a new school of design developed specifically to meet the challenges and conditions of the 21st century. It offers only one degree, an MA in Constructed Realities. Having sat through the presentations for the open day, we were still a little unclear about its distinctions between real realities, unreal realities, real unrealities, and unreal unrealities, but we were intrigued enough to want to know more.
The school provides a mix of theory, practice, and reflection. There are no disciplines in the conventional sense; instead, students study bundles of subjects. Some that caught our attention were “Rhetoric, Ethics, and Critical Theory” combined with “Impossible Architecture”; “Scenario Making and Worldbuilding” mixed with “Ideology and Found Realities”; and “CGI and Simulation Techniques” taught alongside “The History of Propaganda, Conspiracy Theories, Hoaxes, and Advertising.” Projects are expressed through various forms of reality: mixed, immersive, simulated, unmediated, and so on. Students can also attend the classes “Multiverses and Branding,” “The Suspension, Destruction, and Production of Disbelief,” “Reality Fabrication: Bottom Up or Top Down?,” “The Politics of the Unreal,” “Reality: Local Variations,” and our favorite, “The Aesthetics of Unreality.”
After the presentations we asked the director about the thinking behind the school. He was a little reticent at first, which is understandable knowing the risks associated with relocating design from its cozy home in the old reality-based community to a new one among reality makers, fabricators, and constructors, but he was keen to share. He began by explaining that in his view, for most people today reality isn’t working, that it broke sometime near the end of the 20th century: 
“It’s clear that reality only works for a privileged minority, but designers advocate a realist approach, which means they work within the constraints of reality as it is, for the minority. The school aims to challenge this by making reality a little bit bigger to provide more room for different kinds of dreams and hopes. An important part of this process is generating multiple versions of reality, and this is where design comes in.”
“We concluded,” he said, “that the only way to challenge this unsatisfactory situation was to be unrealistic—to breach realism’s heavily policed borders and to fully embrace unreality.” 
Listening to him, we began to think so too.




Anticipationism and philosophy


Let’s start with a quasi-definition. The anticipationism is the future oriented philosophical attitude, according to which we are allowed to try a concrete, conceptual and practical anticipation of some pieces of future, The selection criteria are mostly ethical, political and economic. Grounded between Marxist political philosophy and common reformism , anticipationism operates within the symbolic sphere: showing, here and now, that it is possible to already test or live some potentialities of the future. I defended the idea that anticipa-tionism is the essential approach of the intersection between art and philosophy because philosophy itself can turn many of its arguments in artistic practices (but also in architecture and design). In the Western philosophical world it is currently more and more complex to solve the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy; the former, originally Anglo-american, should find its solutions in logic, while the later, of European origin, has on the other hand ace a “quantity”: it is an alternance of geological ages, of which the anthropocene is the current one and there is no better or worse. Obviously the anthropocene, is intimately connected to our role on this planet and to the structural modification of soils, environments and ecosystems; this does not make though the anthropocene a quality, but rather the context in which all being on Earth are currently living. The connection between quality and quantity can occur by taking anthropocentrism, in fact, and exploring it as a founding concept for the anthropocene but, perhaps, also for its potential conclusion: if the environment starts perceiving us as a virus, sooner or later, it will get rid of us. We got a long list of factors making the anthropocene worrying, but also – paradoxically - interesting: global warming, overheating, pollution, intensive animal farming, etc. Here is the philosophical step backwards and, as we will see, the one for-ward within the art: making possible a set of practices that led the planet to the anthropocentrism, according to which Homo Sapiens has an author.


The problems generating anticipation. The anticipation, of course, is a contingency; it is generated by that ‘im-passe’ we first mentioned happening when, in a complex globalized economy no individual choices nor local reforms can solve the problem that anthropocene humanity should face. Philosophy, more than art, can take care of the symbolic dimension by producing scenarios that, eventually, others will have to bring to completion. I have argued that the concerns about the potential extinction of Homo Sapiens are irrelevant because in fact the extinction is already underway and we are facing a sympatric speciation: two populations evolve separately while living in the same territory. It is a type of evolution oc-curing silently and imperceptibly due to ecological isolation; as we know, humans belong to the genre Homo, whose Sapiens constitutes the last evolutionary form. Chronologically we have: Homo habilis, Homo georgicus, Homo erectus, Homo antecessor, Homo heidelbergensis, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens (appeared about 200,000 years ago). It is therefore not surprising if I consider anthropocene as proof that, after two hundred thousand years, Sapiens has had its day, while mine is a purely philosophical and non-biological discourse. Moving forward, I proposed to name a new species of Homo, potentially present already among us: Post-human Con-temporary Homo, as a population niche able to resist climate change, overcrowding or lack of resources, because it is already currently living according to food, housing and political needs, profoundly different from the main ones characterizing both quality (anthropocentrism) and quantity (anthropocene). The anticipation practice, constantly put in place by this different – while aesthetically in-distinguishable from Homo Sapiens - species, is what allows us to trace both the problems and the solutions to the current environmental challenges. Let’s face a pivotal point. Contemporary posthuman describes a species taking the place of Homo sapiens managing to live on the planet without questioning the habitat but taking advantage of the cultural and technological evolution that paradoxically led the very Homo sapiens to its own possible future extinction. From radical food reformism to the abandonment of cities, there are practices which allow an identification of the new species such as the inclination to live in micro-communities, the life in the woods, vegetable diets, or all that system of behaviours and habits that if adopted en masse would eradicate the problems from their roots. The point is that the answer to this dilemma could be closer than we think. Contemporary philosophical posthuman looks for allies. How can we unfold straight away the diversity of the new species born on the ruins of Homo sapiens? Despite its dense argumentation, philosophy doesn’t seem to be enough helpful. I propose to consider the alliance between philosophy, architecture and art as the basis of this “anticipation theory”. As any other form of life, a new one requires a new environment or, more technically, a structure in which life can develop. Even if Homo sapiens’ habitat cracks and its new form is suitable for the contemporary Posthuman, we still have to deal with a contingent problem; where could contemporary Posthumans live their lives? If the economy and politics persist to not care about ecology, anticipation seems to be a solid option. Looking for independently developed allies, my theory speculates a filling of spaces abandoned by the consumption excess and the waste of resources of Homo sapiens. It’s useful to look at Gilles Clément’s Third Landscape concept; according to him, all the areas abandoned by men, the parks and nature reserves, the largely uninhabited areas of the planet, and also the smallest and most widespread semi-invisible spaces as disused industrial areas, are fundamental resources for the conservation of biological diversity. These are different areas in terms of configuration, dimension and status, sharing only the absence of any human activity. If taken together, they play a crucial role in the development of the new species. The impact of Homo sapiens contracts when the possibilities of contemporary Posthumans develop: the appropriation of these empty areas, left or neglected by capitalism, is the first step of the making of the new habitat in which the speciation will find its place. The symbolic purpose of showing now the way we will live in the future, according to which many other phenomena of human ethics such as civil disobedience or vegetarianism will decline, is fundamental. In 2005 Fernando García-Dory, within a not too different theoretical framework from that of Clément, inaugurated the internal creation of the Commission on Rural Arts of a Rural Platform. This is a contemporary art pro-ject within the act of recovering rural areas discarded in favour of urbanization, thanks to which government commissions allow the construction of art residences or micro-communities with a clear artistic purpose. In 2010 the project took shape under the name Inland - Campo Adentro.


Understood as a contemporary Posthuman graft in all those places abandoned by Homo sapiens in which nature and biodiversity are returning their place, the Third Landscape is the theoretical inverse of Carl Schmitt’s “Great Space” (Großraum), the ultimate aim of a humanism led to the extreme through the desire by the “New Order” (Neue Ordnung). Local anthropocentrism, especially in relation to geocentrism, produces expansion at the expense of neighbours we discover to be not “that close” because “subhuman” (Untermenschen). On the other hand, because of its way to evaluate the coexistence with biodiversity, the Posthuman forms necessary islands of survival on a planet that collapses against its will. The disappearance of Homo sapiens, of course, is a defeat for everyone.


Speciation takes place because Homo sapiens has surpassed the limits imposed by the environment, the reality has resisted, and the feedback has been a new commencement that now art tries to describe and host. Viewed in relation to space and its control, the consequences of anthropocentrism are always treacherous and violent: for this reason, it is better to measure immediately, by the act of anticipating, the strategies employed by a given form of life to relate itself to the environment. The reason why the Third Landscape is a theoretical perspective for contemporary Posthuman is simple. The nature that recovers space, the life that emerges from below and that must be considered, the coexistence with biodiversity... if contemporary Posthuman desires to live a long life it must translate the theoretical assumptions of its speciation into a good practice of life. Architecture intertwined with trees and plants that integrates and shelters instead of destroying and isolating is the viewpoint that opens the theory we are using as a guide to our long journey. We must anticipate to pre-vent and understand, today that Martin Heidegger’s prophecy that “the last man rages for Europe” (let’s consider the conflicts between the Middle East and the contemporary West) seems to come about through conflicts that have more and more the character of a “final solution”. It must be stressed that there should be a total harmony between science, art, and philosophy within this framework. The selection criterion of anticipation can not be arbitrary: it is a philosophical theory that uses scientific evidence to shape certain artistic practices in a triangulation where every single vertex is essential. The Anthropocene issue is emblematic when we highlight its causes and the potential of certain changes of direction for its slowdown; the objection is obvious, I guess: anticipating is not useful at all. Clearly, compared to any normative ethics, anticipation appears to be a “simple” symbolic approach that is not effective at all, but my counter-objection is differ-ent: utilitarianisms or egalitarianisms are just theoretically effective, i.e on paper, not practically.There is no way global damage could be diminished by utilitarian speculations and, moreover, most of these approaches condemn to individual immobility because of the threshold effect: without a fifty percent plus one shifting the axis of effectiveness with respect to the modification.




The construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction. Earlier I suggested that “women of color” might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of “outsider” identities, sedimented in the complex political-historical layerings of Audre Lorde’s “biomy -thography,”Zami (Lorde 1982; King 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential. Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom U.S.workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy preventing their solidarity, threatening their security.Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amid the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. “Women of color” are the preferred labor force for the science-based industries, the real women for whom the worldwide sexual market, labor market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit.Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the “cheap” female labor so attractive to the multinationals.Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the “oral primitive,” literacy is a special mark of women of color, acquired by black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and writing. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in “postmodernist” theories attacking the phallogocentrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name. Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of U.S. women of color are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfillment in apocalypse. The phallogocentric origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies—technologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics—that have recently textualized our bodies ascode problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recording communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of color; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by U.S. women of color. For example, retellings of the story of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo “bastard” race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carryspecial meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. CherríeMoraga in Loving in the War Years (1983) explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, nevertold the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother’s or father’s. Moraga’s writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche’s mastery of the conqueror’s language—a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga’s language is not “whole”; it is self-consciously spliced, a chi -mera of English and Spanish, both conquerors’ languages. Butit is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before violation, that crafts the erotic, competent, potent identities of women of color. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write withoutthe founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writ-ing marks Moraga’s body, affirms it as the body of a woman of color, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of “original illiteracy” of a mother that never was. Malinche was motherhere, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.Writing is preeminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics are the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings that make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of “Western” identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. “We” did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagine the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of texts. From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in “our” privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence,and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile “masculine” separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize “oneself” as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification,vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of identity,the “bastard” race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of color havet transformed her from the evil mother of masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life tobe individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation —These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics—rebirth without flaw,perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake inmasculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological re-sources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborg sare the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many times a “Western” commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by “Western” technology, by writing. These real-life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japa -nese and U.S. electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and societies. Survival is at stake in this play of readings.To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals—in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/made, active/passive,right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be otheris to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial.One is too few, but two are too many.High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what is body in machines that resolve into coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications devices like others.There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic.The replicant Rachel in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture’s fear, love, and confusion.One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tool sis heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communications devices. Anne McCaffrey’s prefeminist The Ship Who Sang(1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl’s brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment,skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodie send at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century till now, machines could be animated—given ghostly souls to make them speak or move orto account for their orderly development and mental capacities.Or organisms could be mechanized—reduced to body under-stood as resource of mind. These machine/organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don’t need organic holism to give impermeable wholeness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artifact,member of a race, individual entity, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on identification. 




Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory isa major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always,but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skillful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia.It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the super savers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.


Drawing a parallel between the original Gaia concept and a possible Gaia 2.0 gives an occasion to reevaluate our collective goals, as well as the means of achieving them. A central goal for this century is surely to achieve a flourishing future for all life on this planet, including a projected 9 to 11 billion people. Human flourishing is not possible without a biodiverse, life-sustaining Earth system. But achieving those goals requires that human societies exercise self-aware self-regulation. Yet, maintaining a self-regulating, human life–supporting planet is not the primary goal of some dominant modes of collective human activity today. Despite a flood of monitor-ing information, present industrial societies seem less able to track changes in their environment than the life-forms that compose Gaia, because that information is often ignored where it matters by those in power . It’s as if purposelessness had shifted from the natural to the social domain.`
